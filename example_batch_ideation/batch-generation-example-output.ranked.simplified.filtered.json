Agent performance on most text games is low, because these tasks tend to be hard for them.  Instead of expecting success (which is very rare, and infrequently happens on some environments, if ever), you should measure task progress in terms of the partial progress scores that most environments provide.\n2. Similarly, remember that if an agent has separate training and evaluation periods, that (during evaluation) the memory of the agent should be reset to what it was at the end of training.  That way, it won't be using knowledge obtained in one evaluation episode for another evaluation episode. (Note that it can still record memories /during/ the evaluation episodes, but memories from one evaluation episode shouldn't be retained to another; only from training episodes -- unless there is some 'continual learning' framing to the research question).\n3. There are separate train, development, and test sets for most environments.  The train set is used to train the agent, and the development set is used to evaluate it's performance at all times except during the final experiment.  No knowledge of the test set can leak into the design or tuning of the agent.\n4. Generally mini-pilot experiments can run on only 2-3 episodes for fast debugging, up to 10 or 20 steps.  Pilot and full experiments should run on ~50 episodes, to the same number of steps (e.g. 25 or 50 steps).\n5. Most environments provide a set of seeds for training, development, and testing.  If you randomly shuffle these lists of seeds (with a static seed, like 42, so this shuffle is repeatable across runs), then you will get a more representative cross-section of the environment's problems.  Environments are often parametrically generated, and just taking incremental seeds (i.e. 1, 2, 3, ...) rather than randomly ordered seeds (e.g. 103, 40, 97, ...) may generate very similar problems, and not be representative.\n6. Remember to include appropriate baselines.  For example, an appropriate baseline for `Model A augmented with change X` is almost always `Model A without change X`, not a different model (like a random baseline).\nDETAILS: Remember to be very explicit about including details in your experiment descriptions, particularly if your ideas are based off the input papers. The input papers are NOT available to follow-on stages, so your idea must be *SELF-CONTAINED*, and describe everything that is needed to implement it faithfully.\nSCOPE: While you should use the provided codeblock templates, you should not feel entirely constrained by them -- anything that a language model can reasonably implement is fair game.  However, remember that the codeblocks are designed to be easy to implement, and that the more complex the code that a language model has to implement from scratch, the more likely it is to have bugs, or not work -- especially if it requires downloading external code.\nAUTOMATED: The experiments that you create should be experiments that can be run in a fully-automated fashion, and not require human input.\n",

Agent performance on most text games is low, because these tasks tend to be hard for them.  Instead of expecting success (which is very rare, and infrequently happens on some environments, if ever), you should measure task progress in terms of the partial progress scores that most environments provide.\n2. Similarly, remember that if an agent has separate training and evaluation periods, that (during evaluation) the memory of the agent should be reset to what it was at the end of training.  That way, it won't be using knowledge obtained in one evaluation episode for another evaluation episode. (Note that it can still record memories /during/ the evaluation episodes, but memories from one evaluation episode shouldn't be retained to another; only from training episodes -- unless there is some 'continual learning' framing to the research question).\n3. There are separate train, development, and test sets for most environments.  The train set is used to train the agent, and the development set is used to evaluate it's performance at all times except during the final experiment.  No knowledge of the test set can leak into the design or tuning of the agent.\n4. Generally mini-pilot experiments can run on only 2-3 episodes for fast debugging, up to 10 or 20 steps.  Pilot and full experiments should run on ~50 episodes, to the same number of steps (e.g. 25 or 50 steps).\n5. Most environments provide a set of seeds for training, development, and testing.  If you randomly shuffle these lists of seeds (with a static seed, like 42, so this shuffle is repeatable across runs), then you will get a more representative cross-section of the environment's problems.  Environments are often parametrically generated, and just taking incremental seeds (i.e. 1, 2, 3, ...) rather than randomly ordered seeds (e.g. 103, 40, 97, ...) may generate very similar problems, and not be representative.\n6. Remember to include appropriate baselines.  For example, an appropriate baseline for `Model A augmented with change X` is almost always `Model A without change X`, not a different model (like a random baseline).\nDETAILS: Remember to be very explicit about including details in your experiment descriptions, particularly if your ideas are based off the input papers. The input papers are NOT available to follow-on stages, so your idea must be *SELF-CONTAINED*, and describe everything that is needed to implement it faithfully.\nSCOPE: While you should use the provided codeblock templates, you should not feel entirely constrained by them -- anything that a language model can reasonably implement is fair game.  However, remember that the codeblocks are designed to be easy to implement, and that the more complex the code that a language model has to implement from scratch, the more likely it is to have bugs, or not work -- especially if it requires downloading external code.\nAUTOMATED: The experiments that you create should be experiments that can be run in a fully-automated fashion, and not require human input.\n",

      "additional_conditioning_text": "RESEARCH METHODS: Important things to remember regarding research methods in this domain:\n1. Agent performance on most text games is low, because these tasks tend to be hard for them.  Instead of expecting success (which is very rare, and infrequently happens on some environments, if ever), you should measure task progress in terms of the partial progress scores that most environments provide.\n2. Similarly, remember that if an agent has separate training and evaluation periods, that (during evaluation) the memory of the agent should be reset to what it was at the end of training.  That way, it won't be using knowledge obtained in one evaluation episode for another evaluation episode. (Note that it can still record memories /during/ the evaluation episodes, but memories from one evaluation episode shouldn't be retained to another; only from training episodes -- unless there is some 'continual learning' framing to the research question).\n3. There are separate train, development, and test sets for most environments.  The train set is used to train the agent, and the development set is used to evaluate it's performance at all times except during the final experiment.  No knowledge of the test set can leak into the design or tuning of the agent.\n4. Generally mini-pilot experiments can run on only 2-3 episodes for fast debugging, up to 10 or 20 steps.  Pilot and full experiments should run on ~50 episodes, to the same number of steps (e.g. 25 or 50 steps).\n5. Most environments provide a set of seeds for training, development, and testing.  If you randomly shuffle these lists of seeds (with a static seed, like 42, so this shuffle is repeatable across runs), then you will get a more representative cross-section of the environment's problems.  Environments are often parametrically generated, and just taking incremental seeds (i.e. 1, 2, 3, ...) rather than randomly ordered seeds (e.g. 103, 40, 97, ...) may generate very similar problems, and not be representative.\n6. Remember to include appropriate baselines.  For example, an appropriate baseline for `Model A augmented with change X` is almost always `Model A without change X`, not a different model (like a random baseline).\nDETAILS: Remember to be very explicit about including details in your experiment descriptions, particularly if your ideas are based off the input papers. The input papers are NOT available to follow-on stages, so your idea must be *SELF-CONTAINED*, and describe everything that is needed to implement it faithfully.\nSCOPE: While you should use the provided codeblock templates, you should not feel entirely constrained by them -- anything that a language model can reasonably implement is fair game.
