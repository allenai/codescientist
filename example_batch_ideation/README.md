## CodeScientist Batch Ideation Example

This directory contains example files that are generated through the batch ideation process.  These may be useful examples if you plan to:

- Pre-generate (then filter) a large set of ideas, using CodeScientist's batch ideator. 
- If you want to import your own ideas (created with your own external tool) into CodeScientist. 

Please see the main README, `Pregenerated Ideas/Filtering Ideas Externally` section for instructions on how to pre-generate ideas.
