Hierarchical Elimination:\n- Stage 1 (Room Level): Use gpt-4o-mini with prompt template:\n  \"Given the task '[TASK]', is the room/area '[ROOM]' likely to contain useful items? Respond with a number between 0 and 1, where 1 means definitely useful.\"\n- Stage 2 (Object Level): For remaining rooms, use gpt-4o-mini with:\n  \"Given the task '[TASK]', is the object '[OBJECT]' likely to be useful? Respond with a number between 0 and 1.\"\n- Use threshold 0.4 for both stages\n\n2.

For each condition:\n   - Calculate precision/recall of relevant object identification\n   - Track computation time\n   - Record scores\n\nVisualization Requirements:\n1. Generate line plots showing:\n   - Average score vs episode number for each condition\n   - Average computation time vs episode number\n2. Generate bar plots showing:\n   - Precision/recall for each condition\n   - For hierarchical condition: accuracy at room vs object level\n\nStatistical Analysis:\n- Use bootstrap resampling to compare performance between conditions\n- Report p-values for key metrics\n\nOutput Requirements:\n1. Save all plots as PDFs\n2. Generate a results.json file with summary statistics\n3. Log all raw data and decisions for later analysis\n\nIMPORTANT: Start with MINI_PILOT mode. If successful, proceed to PILOT mode. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT mode - this requires manual verification of pilot results before proceeding.\n\nNote: All LLM calls must use gpt-4o-mini through the proxy server interface.",

PILOT: 5 episodes per strategy, 20 steps max per episode\n3. FULL_EXPERIMENT: 20 episodes per strategy, 30 steps max per episode\n\nThe implementation should proceed as follows:\n\n1. Create a MemoryManager class that stores memories as dictionaries with fields:\n   - action: str (the action taken)\n   - observation: str (the observation received)\n   - timestamp: int (step number when stored)\n   - usage_count: int (number of times retrieved)\n   - memory_limit: int (10 items for all modes)\n\n2. Implement three pruning strategies as subclasses:\n   - TimeBasedMemory: Removes oldest memories when limit reached\n   - FrequencyBasedMemory: Removes least-used memories when limit reached\n   - RandomMemory: Randomly selects memories to remove (baseline)\n   - NoMemoryPruning: Keeps first N memories, discards rest (baseline)\n\n3. Augment the ReAct agent template with memory:\n   - Add memory storage after each action\n   - Add memory retrieval in thinking step\n   - Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls\n   - Prompt the agent to use its memory when planning actions\n\n4. Test on ScienceWorld boiling water task:\n   - Use task_num=0 (boiling task)\n   - Use simplification_str='easy'\n   - Record per episode:\n     * Final score (not binary success/failure)\n     * Steps taken\n     * Number of memory retrievals\n     * Memory statistics (size, prunes)\n\n5. Data Collection:\n   Save results in a JSON file with structure:\n   {\n     'strategy': str,  // pruning strategy name\n     'episode': int,    // episode number\n     'score': float,    // final score (0-1)\n     'steps': int,      // steps taken\n     'retrievals': int, // number of memory retrievals\n     'num_prunes': int  // number of times memory was pruned\n   }\n\n6. Analysis:\n   - Calculate mean/std of scores per strategy\n   - Use bootstrap resampling to compare:\n     * Frequency vs Time-based\n     * Each strategy vs baselines\n   - Generate summary statistics for memory usage\n\n7. Implementation Notes:\n   - Start with MINI_PILOT mode\n   - Log all major events/errors\n   - Stop after PILOT mode (human verification required)\n   - Save agent trajectories for manual inspection\n\nThe experiment should focus on measuring how different memory pruning strategies affect the agent's ability to make progress on the boiling water task, as measured by the task score (not binary success/failure).",

PILOT MODES:\nImplement a global variable PILOT_MODE that can be set to:\n- MINI_PILOT: 2 episodes, max 20 steps each, train set only\n- PILOT: 10 episodes, max 50 steps each, using train set (5 episodes) and dev set (5 episodes)\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: 50 episodes, max 100 steps each, proper train/dev/test split\nThe code should first run MINI_PILOT, and if successful, run PILOT. It should not automatically proceed to FULL_EXPERIMENT.\n\n2. ENVIRONMENT SETUP:\n- Use TextWorldExpress CookingWorld\n- Configure for 2 rooms\n- Set numIngredients=2 for MINI_PILOT, numIngredients=3 for PILOT/FULL_EXPERIMENT\n- Set includeDoors=0 to simplify navigation\n\n3. AGENT IMPLEMENTATIONS:\na) Planning Agent (Experimental):\n- Modify the ReAct agent to include a planning phase\n- Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls\n- Planning prompt should ask for 2-3 concrete steps to achieve the goal\n- Execute each planned step using the ReAct architecture\n- Store the plan and execution steps in the logger\n\nb) Baselines:\n- Standard ReAct agent (without planning phase)\n- Random agent (from TextWorldExpress)\n\n4. EVALUATION PROCEDURE:\nFor each episode:\n- Record the task score (0-1 continuous value)\n- Record number of steps taken\n- For planning agent, record generated plan and whether each step was executable\n- Store full trajectory in logger\n\n5. ANALYSIS:\n- Calculate mean task scores and efficiency ratios\n- Use bootstrap resampling to compare planning agent vs each baseline\n- Generate line plots showing:\n  * Task scores over episodes\n  * Number of steps taken over episodes\n  * Planning success rate (for planning agent)\n\n6. LOGGING:\n- Log all LLM interactions\n- Log all plans generated\n- Log all actions taken and observations received\n- Log task scores and metrics\n\n7. OUTPUT:\n- Save plots as PDFs\n- Generate summary statistics\n- Report bootstrap comparison results\n- For PILOT modes, include recommendation about proceeding to next stage\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n1. Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls to minimize costs\n2. Focus on task score rather than binary completion\n3. Start with MINI_PILOT to verify basic functionality\n4. Implement proper error handling and logging\n5. Save all results and plots with pilot mode in filename\n\nExpected directory structure:\n/results/\n  - {PILOT_MODE}_scores.json\n  - {PILOT_MODE}_metrics.json\n  - {PILOT_MODE}_plots/\n    - task_scores.pdf\n    - steps_taken.pdf\n    - planning_success.pdf\n  - {PILOT_MODE}_logs/\n    - log.json\n    - llm_interactions.json\n    - plans.json",

However, these differences did not reach statistical significance (p=0.11), and critically, neither agent achieved any successful task completions (0% success rate for both). The experiment was properly implemented according to specifications, with appropriate logging, analysis, and visualization. The results suggest that while WordNet guidance may provide some benefit in action selection efficiency, the advantage wasn't sufficient to achieve task completion in the tested environment configuration (2 locations, 2 ingredients). Given the lack of statistical significance and successful completions, the evidence is deemed inconclusive regarding the original hypothesis. Further experimentation with larger sample sizes, longer episodes, or modified environment parameters might be necessary to draw more definitive conclusions about the efficacy of WordNet-guided exploration in cooking tasks.",

Critically, the LLM assigned nearly identical confidence scores to both correct and incorrect predictions across all experiments, showing poor calibration. The LLM exhibited overconfidence, with average confidence scores consistently high (0.78-0.91) regardless of prediction correctness.

The confidence agent made fewer updates (279) compared to baseline (460), suggesting more conservative behavior.

All four experiments consistently refuted the hypothesis. In each case, the confidence-based ReAct agent either performed worse than or equal to the baseline agent that updated graphs directly without confidence reasoning. Specifically, in copy1, the baseline agent achieved 50.8% accuracy versus 43.4% for the confidence agent. In copy2, both agents showed identical (poor) performance with mean scores of 0.0. In copy4, the baseline agent achieved 70.6% accuracy versus 67.0% for the confidence agent. In copy5, both agents showed identical low accuracy of approximately 9%. While statistical significance was not reached in most comparisons (p-values ranged from 0.559 to 1.0), the consistent pattern across all experiments strongly suggests that explicit confidence reasoning does not improve graph accuracy in this context. In fact, the confidence-based agent tended to be more conservative in making updates (as noted in copy2), which may have contributed to its equal or worse performance. All experiments were conducted as pilot studies with 10 episodes of 25 steps each, using simplified CookingWorld settings. The consistent results across different implementations strengthen the conclusion that, contrary to the hypothesis, explicit confidence reasoning does not improve belief graph accuracy in this environment. Future work might explore whether confidence reasoning could be beneficial in more complex environments or with different implementations of confidence thresholding and filtering mechanisms.",

The experiment should support three modes (PILOT_MODE values: 'MINI_PILOT', 'PILOT', 'FULL_EXPERIMENT'), starting with MINI_PILOT.\n\n1. Environment Setup:\n- Use TextWorldExpress cooking tasks\n- Configure environment parameters:\n  * MINI_PILOT: 2 episodes, numLocations=3, numIngredients=2, numDistractorItems=2, includeDoors=0\n  * PILOT: 5 episodes, numLocations=5, numIngredients=3, numDistractorItems=5, includeDoors=0\n  * FULL_EXPERIMENT: 50 episodes, numLocations=11, numIngredients=5, numDistractorItems=10, includeDoors=1\n\n2. Agent Implementation:\n- Implement two agents using the ReAct Agent Example template:\n  a) Baseline: Standard ReAct agent with basic reflection\n  b) Experimental: ReAct agent with experience-augmented reflection\n- Both agents should use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls\n- Maximum steps per episode:\n  * MINI_PILOT: 20 steps\n  * PILOT: 50 steps\n  * FULL_EXPERIMENT: 100 steps\n\n3.

Reflection System:\n- Baseline agent reflection prompt template:\n  \"Given the current observation and your recent actions, what went wrong and how should you modify your approach? Current observation: [obs], Recent actions: [actions]\"\n\n- Experimental agent reflection prompt template:\n  \"Given the current observation and your recent actions, what went wrong? Here's a similar successful experience: [past_experience]. How can you adapt that successful approach to the current situation? Current observation: [obs], Recent actions: [actions]\"\n\n5. Evaluation:\n- For each episode:\n  * Maximum 5 attempts per task\n  * Record: success/failure, steps taken, final score\n  * Log all reflections generated\n  * Store successful experiences for the experimental agent\n\n6. Analysis:\n- Calculate per-episode metrics:\n  * Success rate\n  * Average steps to completion (successful episodes)\n  * Average number of attempts needed\n- Use bootstrap resampling to compare baseline vs experimental:\n  * Success rates\n  * Steps to completion\n  * Number of attempts needed\n\n7. Logging:\n- Use the Logger to record:\n  * All agent actions and observations\n  * All reflections generated\n  * All successful experiences stored\n  * Performance metrics\n  * Error messages and warnings\n\n8. Execution Flow:\n1. Start with MINI_PILOT mode\n2. If successful, proceed to PILOT mode\n3. Stop after PILOT mode (human verification required for FULL_EXPERIMENT)\n\n9. Output:\n- Generate a JSON report with:\n  * Configuration settings used\n  * Performance metrics for both agents\n  * Statistical comparison results\n  * Example reflections from both agents\n  * Any errors or warnings encountered\n\nNote: Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls to maintain fast execution and low cost.

This systematic miscalibration between confidence and accuracy suggests that while there may be a weak positive correlation in most cases, raw confidence scores from this LLM are not reliable indicators for identifying potentially incorrect predictions in practice. The variability in results across experiments (with correlations ranging from -0.035 to 0.351) also indicates that the relationship between confidence and accuracy may be sensitive to specific implementation details or environmental parameters. Overall, while the hypothesis receives more support than refutation, the practical utility of confidence scores for identifying incorrect predictions appears limited due to the LLM's persistent overconfidence bias.",

None of the experiments provided clear support for the hypothesis, while two experiments actively refuted it, and three were inconclusive. A key limitation across all experiments was the lack of ground truth evaluation to directly measure graph accuracy. Instead, most experiments used indirect metrics like graph size, triple removal counts, or game performance.\n\nThe experiments consistently showed that LLM verification substantially reduced the number of triples in knowledge graphs (ranging from ~31% reduction to extreme cases where almost all triples were removed). However, this aggressive pruning appears problematic. In experiments 3 and 4, LLM verification actually led to worse game performance, suggesting the verification process may have removed valid and useful information. Experiments 1, 2, and 5 showed similar patterns of substantial triple removal but couldn't conclusively determine if this improved actual graph accuracy.\n\nA consistent pattern across experiments was that LLM verification appeared overly conservative or strict, often removing large numbers of triples without adequate replacement or correction. This suggests potential issues with the verification prompt design or the LLM's tendency to be risk-averse in validation tasks.\n\nMethodological limitations were significant across all experiments: small sample sizes (10 episodes each), short episode lengths (30 steps), low game scores indicating limited progression, and most critically, no direct evaluation against ground truth knowledge. The bootstrap analyses consistently showed no statistically significant improvements from LLM verification (p-values near 1.0).\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence from these experiments suggests that the simple LLM verification approach implemented here does not improve knowledge graph accuracy and may actually be detrimental by removing too much information. Future work should include ground truth evaluation, more sophisticated verification prompts that not only identify but also correct problematic triples, and larger sample sizes to increase statistical power.",

The enhanced agent with location tracking achieved a higher mean score (0.508) compared to the baseline ReAct agent (0.471), suggesting a potential advantage. Additionally, the experimental agent demonstrated better spatial awareness by visiting 2-3 rooms per episode, while the baseline had 0 recorded visits. However, these differences were not statistically significant (bootstrap p=0.278), likely due to the small sample size. Both agents encountered similar challenges with inventory management given the size limitation. The results are promising but inconclusive, suggesting that location tracking may improve performance, but a larger-scale experiment with more episodes is needed to establish statistical significance. Future work should include the full experiment with 50 episodes per condition as originally planned, and potentially explore variations in environment complexity to better understand when location tracking provides the most benefit.",

In four of the five experiments, both approaches achieved perfect 100% success rates across all technical validity metrics, including execution success, presence of required mechanics (movement, inventory, scoring, win conditions), and absence of syntax errors. These experiments were deemed inconclusive as they showed no detectable differences between the approaches.\n\nOnly one experiment (copy4) showed a slight advantage for the two-stage approach, where it achieved 100% implementation of all required mechanics compared to 90% for the single-stage approach (which had one game missing inventory commands). This provides weak support for the hypothesis.\n\nThe consistently high success rates across both approaches suggest several possibilities: (1) the task may have been too simple to differentiate between approaches, (2) the model used (gpt-4o-mini) may be sufficiently capable that the incremental approach offers no significant advantage for this particular task complexity, or (3) the evaluation metrics may not have been sensitive enough to detect qualitative differences between the approaches.\n\nLimitations of this meta-analysis include the small sample size (5 games per condition in each experiment), focus on basic functionality rather than more nuanced quality metrics, and potential ceiling effects due to the high success rates. Future research should consider more complex game requirements, more sensitive evaluation metrics that go beyond basic functionality checks (such as code quality, modularity, or playability assessments), and larger sample sizes to better detect potential differences between the approaches.",

The experiment was run in PILOT mode with 10 episodes per condition. The graph-tracking agent showed better average performance (avg score 0.537 vs 0.311) and success rate (30% vs 0%) compared to baseline, though with the small sample size the bootstrap analysis showed this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.151). The graph-tracking agent completed more episodes successfully (3/10 vs 0/10) and required fewer steps on average (14.8 vs 20.0). The implementation included most key requested features including graph state tracking, DOT visualization, and bootstrap analysis, though some features like graph snapshots at key points were not fully implemented. Both agents struggled with exploration and sequential reasoning, often getting stuck in loops or failing to find ingredients, suggesting room for improvement in the base ReAct architecture regardless of graph tracking."

Only one experiment was conducted, comparing a baseline ReAct agent against a graph-tracking ReAct agent in CookingWorld's sandwich-making task. The experiment ran in PILOT mode with 10 episodes per condition.\n\nThe results showed promising trends favoring the graph-tracking agent: it achieved a higher average score (0.537 vs 0.311), successfully completed more episodes (3/10 vs 0/10), and required fewer steps on average (14.8 vs 20.0). These metrics align with the hypothesis that graph-based state tracking improves task efficiency. However, bootstrap analysis revealed these differences were not statistically significant (p=0.151), likely due to the small sample size.\n\nBoth agent types struggled with exploration and sequential reasoning, often getting stuck in loops or failing to find ingredients. This suggests fundamental limitations in the base ReAct architecture that persist regardless of state tracking capabilities.\n\nWhile the experiment shows promising directional support for the hypothesis, the lack of statistical significance and limited sample size necessitate classifying the results as inconclusive. A full experiment with the planned 100 episodes per condition would provide more definitive evidence. Future work should also address the underlying exploration and sequential reasoning challenges observed in both agent types.",

The second experiment reported consistent performance across all three metrics, with each achieving 56% accuracy. Both experiments exceeded the PILOT success criterion of >50% accuracy with at least one metric.\n\nThe discrepancy in relative performance between experiments raises questions about implementation differences. In the first experiment, the custom metric implementation was noted as basic, focusing on simple node/edge matching rather than using the proposed GPT-4-mini for relationship extraction. The second experiment's identical performance across all metrics suggests possible methodological issues in the evaluation process.\n\nDespite these inconsistencies, both experiments demonstrate that at least some basic similarity metrics can achieve above-chance alignment between text descriptions and graph representations of game states. The word overlap metric consistently performed well across both experiments, suggesting that even simple lexical matching can capture meaningful alignment between different representations of the same game state.\n\nFuture work should address the implementation discrepancies, particularly for the custom graph-text similarity metric, and explore why Jaccard similarity performed so differently between experiments. Additionally, the relationship between similarity scores and game progress, which was part of the original research plan, was not clearly reported in either experiment's results summary.",

The experiment tested four levels of state complexity: boolean-only, numerical, relational, and full state descriptions. Using gpt-4o-mini as the LLM, the experiment collected data from 10 episodes with 25 steps each across training and dev sets. Results showed a clear degradation in prediction accuracy as state complexity increased: boolean-only (90.3% \u00b1 15.2%), numerical (76.5% \u00b1 11.5%), relational (76.3% \u00b1 11.4%), and full state (56.5% \u00b1 6.1%). Bootstrap resampling analysis showed statistically significant differences between the baseline boolean-only condition and each higher complexity level (all p=1.0). The experiment demonstrated that increased state complexity significantly impairs LLM prediction accuracy, with the most dramatic drop occurring between boolean-only and numerical representations, and between relational and full state descriptions. The implementation followed the experimental design faithfully, including proper environment setup, data collection, statistical analysis, and visualization."

The experiments tested four levels of complexity: boolean-only, numerical, relational, and full state descriptions, using gpt-4o-mini as the LLM across all conditions.\n\nThree experiments (copies 1, 3, and 5) supported the hypothesis that LLMs show degrading performance as state complexity increases. These experiments demonstrated a general downward trend in prediction accuracy as complexity increased, with particularly notable drops when moving to relational or full state representations. Two experiments (copies 2 and 4) refuted the hypothesis, showing either improved performance with increased complexity or non-monotonic patterns where full state descriptions outperformed simpler representations.\n\nAcross all experiments, boolean-only states generally achieved high accuracy (ranging from 20% to 93.2%, with most above 70%). The performance on numerical states was more variable (50.3% to 90.6%). Relational states showed the most inconsistent results across experiments (44.3% to 88.3%), while full state descriptions typically performed worse than simpler representations in most experiments (54.1% to 76.1%).\n\nThe inconsistency between experiments suggests that factors beyond just state complexity may influence LLM prediction accuracy. These could include differences in the specific state transitions encountered, the quality of the LLM's responses to particular prompts, or variations in how the state representations were constructed and presented to the model.\n\nDespite these inconsistencies, the majority of experiments (3 out of 5) support the hypothesis that increasing state complexity generally degrades LLM prediction accuracy. However, the specific pattern of degradation and the relative difficulty of different complexity levels varied across experiments, suggesting that the relationship between state complexity and LLM performance is nuanced and may depend on additional factors not fully controlled for in these experiments.",

The experiments were conducted in PILOT mode with 10 episodes each, using environments with 3 rooms and testing 10-20 KG triples per episode with an 80/20 correct/incorrect ratio.\n\nKey findings across both experiments:\n\n1. The verification agent significantly outperformed random exploration in both experiments, with verification rates of 78.9% and 91% compared to baseline rates of 51.4% and 54%, respectively.\n\n2. Statistical significance was established in both experiments (p<0.001), providing strong evidence for the superiority of structured exploration over random interaction.\n\n3. The verification agent demonstrated efficiency in triple verification, requiring substantially fewer steps per verification in the second experiment (5.7 steps vs. 31.2 steps for random exploration).\n\n4. The agent showed consistent performance across episodes, maintaining approximately 80% accuracy in distinguishing correct from incorrect triples.\n\n5. The ReAct architecture proved effective for knowledge graph verification, enabling systematic exploration and reasoning about triple relationships.\n\nThese results consistently demonstrate that a structured approach to environment exploration using ReAct reasoning is substantially more effective than random exploration for knowledge graph verification in text environments. The agent's ability to systematically plan verification steps, execute relevant actions, and reason about observations enabled it to efficiently validate or refute knowledge graph triples. This provides compelling evidence that interactive agents can serve as effective tools for verifying automatically constructed knowledge graphs, addressing a key gap in automated KG construction - validation of the generated graphs.",

Both experiments used the same setup: PILOT mode with 25 episodes, 30 steps max per episode, on 3 different TWC games.

The failure tracking mechanism appeared to help in the first experiment by preventing the agent from repeating mistakes, but this advantage did not materialize in the second experiment.

The experiment should have the following components:\n\n1. PILOT MODES\nImplement a global variable PILOT_MODE that can be set to one of:\n- MINI_PILOT: Test on 2 scenarios, 3 episodes each, max 5 steps per episode\n- PILOT: Test on all 5 scenarios, 5 episodes each, max 10 steps per episode\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Test on all 5 scenarios, 20 episodes each, max 25 steps per episode\n\nStart with MINI_PILOT, then if successful, run PILOT. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT.\n\n2. TEST SCENARIOS\nImplement these 5 simple scenarios (use fewer for MINI_PILOT):\na) \"Birthday Party\": 3 characters (Alice, Bob, Charlie). Alice and Bob are friends, both neutral to Charlie. Decision task: Who to invite to a party?\nb) \"Resource Competition\": 3 characters (David, Emma, Frank). David and Emma are enemies, Frank neutral to both. Decision task: How to distribute limited resources?\nc) \"Group Project\": 3 characters (Grace, Henry, Isabel). Grace and Isabel are friends, Henry enemy to Grace. Decision task: How to assign project roles?\nd) \"Lunch Plans\": 2 characters (John, Karen). Initially neutral. Decision task: Where to have lunch given preferences?\ne) \"Moving Help\": 3 characters (Lisa, Mike, Nina). Lisa friend with both others, Mike and Nina enemies. Decision task: Who should help with moving?\n\n3. AGENT CONDITIONS\nImplement three agent conditions:\na) Experimental Agent (with graph):\n   - Maintains DOT/Graphviz graph of relationships (friend/neutral/enemy)\n   - Updates relationships based on interaction outcomes\n   - Uses relationships to inform decisions\nb) Baseline Agent (no graph):\n   - Makes decisions without relationship tracking\n   - Uses only current scenario information\nc) Static Baseline Agent:\n   - Always assumes friendly relationships\n   - Makes decisions based on this assumption\n\n4. EVALUATION METRICS\nFor each episode:\na) Primary metric: Decision appropriateness (rated by gpt-4o-mini)\n   - Score 0-10 for each decision\n   - Provide context and relationship state to evaluator\nb) Secondary metric: Graph consistency\n   - Track changes in relationship states\n   - Log all graph states (save as DOT files, convert to PDF)\n\n5. IMPLEMENTATION STEPS\na) Initialize scenario:\n   - Create character nodes in graph\n   - Set initial relationships\n   - Save initial graph state\nb) For each step:\n   - Log current state\n   - Agent makes decision\n   - Update relationships\n   - Save updated graph\n   - Log decision and rationale\nc) After each episode:\n   - Save final graph state\n   - Get gpt-4o-mini evaluation of decisions\n   - Calculate consistency metrics\n\n6. DATA COLLECTION\nFor each condition:\n- Log all decisions and rationales\n- Save all graph states as DOT files\n- Convert DOT files to PDF for visualization\n- Store evaluator scores\n- Track relationship changes\n\n7. ANALYSIS\nCompare conditions using bootstrap resampling:\n- Primary: Decision appropriateness scores\n- Secondary: Graph consistency metrics\n- Generate summary statistics\n- Create comparison visualizations\n\n8. OUTPUT\nGenerate a report containing:\n- Summary statistics for each condition\n- Bootstrap resampling results\n- Graph visualizations (as PDFs)\n- Decision logs\n- Evaluator scores\n\nNOTE: Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls (agent decisions and evaluation) to maintain consistency and reduce costs.\n\nThe experiment should first run in MINI_PILOT mode. If successful, proceed to PILOT mode. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT mode for human verification.",

The experiment ran in PILOT mode with 5 scenarios, 5 episodes each. Results showed that the experimental agent (mean score 7.96) actually performed worse than both the baseline (mean score 9.0) and static baseline (mean score 8.84). Bootstrap analysis with 25 paired samples showed no significant advantage for the experimental condition (p=1.0). The experimental agent made more conservative and exclusive decisions (e.g., consistently excluding neutral parties) while tracking relationships, whereas the baseline agents made more inclusive decisions that were rated more favorably by the evaluator. This suggests that simple relationship tracking may lead to overly cautious social decisions that are suboptimal compared to more inclusive strategies."

The experiments implemented three agent types: experimental (with relationship graph), baseline (no graph), and static baseline (assumes friendly relationships).\n\nThree experiments (copies 2, 3, and 4) supported the hypothesis, showing the experimental agent consistently outperformed the baseline agent without relationship tracking. These experiments demonstrated that relationship-aware agents made more contextually appropriate decisions, particularly in scenarios with conflicting relationships.\n\nOne experiment (copy1) refuted the hypothesis, with the experimental agent (7.96) scoring lower than both the baseline (9.0) and static baseline (8.84). This experiment suggested that relationship tracking led to overly cautious, exclusive decisions that were rated less favorably than more inclusive strategies.\n\nOne experiment (copy5) produced inconclusive results, as the experimental agent (7.992) performed significantly better than the baseline agent (7.604) but worse than the static baseline (9.072). This suggests that while relationship tracking may improve decision-making compared to no tracking, simply assuming friendly relationships might be even more effective in some contexts.\n\nKey limitations across experiments include small sample sizes, limited scenario complexity, potential evaluation bias from using the same LLM for decisions and evaluations, and inconsistent implementation of evaluation metrics. The mixed results suggest that the effectiveness of relationship tracking may depend on specific implementation details, evaluation criteria, and scenario characteristics.\n\nOverall, while the majority of experiments support the hypothesis that relationship tracking improves social decision-making compared to no tracking, the evidence is not unanimous. The surprising effectiveness of the static baseline (assuming friendly relationships) in some experiments suggests that the optimal approach may depend on the social context and evaluation criteria.

The analysis is based on a single experiment that compared three agents: (1) a decomposition agent that breaks tasks into two steps before execution, (2) an end-to-end agent that approaches tasks directly, and (3) a random baseline agent. The experiment was conducted in PILOT mode with 20 episodes of 25 max steps each across 5 different tasks.\n\nThe results provide support for the original hypothesis that decomposition improves performance. The decomposition agent achieved a significantly higher average score (0.178) compared to both the end-to-end agent (0.0) and random agent (0.025), with bootstrap analysis confirming statistical significance (p < 0.001). This indicates that breaking down tasks into component steps does provide an advantage in navigating complex environments and making progress toward goals.\n\nHowever, an important limitation was observed: despite the decomposition agent's superior performance, no agent achieved complete task success (all had 0.0 success rates). This suggests that while decomposition provides a measurable advantage in partial task completion, the overall two-step cooking tasks remained challenging for all approaches. The decomposition strategy appears to help the agent make more progress toward the goal, even if it doesn't lead to full task completion within the constraints of the experiment.\n\nThese findings suggest that explicit decomposition is a beneficial strategy for LLMs tackling multi-step tasks, even when complete success remains elusive. Future research could explore extending the maximum steps allowed, refining the decomposition prompts, or investigating whether the benefits of decomposition scale with task complexity. The experiment provides valuable evidence that structured approaches to problem-solving can enhance LLM performance in interactive environments, even when the tasks remain challenging overall.",

The system should be implemented in phases:\n\nPHASE 1: ENVIRONMENT GENERATION\n1. Create a simple text game environment class that supports:\n   - Single room environments\n   - Objects that can be picked up and dropped\n   - Simple goals (e.g., 'pick up the red book')\n   - Valid action generation (look, inventory, take X, drop X)\n   - State tracking (object locations, inventory)\n\n2. Create a template-based generator that:\n   - Uses a JSON template format for room/object definitions\n   - Generates environments with 2-6 objects\n   - Supports object properties (color, size)\n   - Creates simple goals (pick up X)\n\n3. Create 5 manually designed baseline environments using the same format\n\nPHASE 2: AGENT EVALUATION\n1. Implement a ReAct agent evaluation pipeline that:\n   - Uses gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls\n   - Records success/failure and steps to completion\n   - Logs full trajectories\n   - Calculates metrics (success rate, avg steps, valid actions/state)\n\nPHASE 3: ANALYSIS\n1. Implement statistical comparison using bootstrap resampling\n2. Generate performance plots\n3. Save all results and environments as JSON\n\nPILOT EXPERIMENT STRUCTURE:\nPlease implement three experiment modes controlled by a global PILOT_MODE variable:\n\nMINI_PILOT:\n- Generate 2 template environments (2-3 objects each)\n- Generate 2 manual baseline environments\n- Run 3 episodes per environment\n- Maximum 10 steps per episode\n- Use training set seeds\n- Purpose: Quick code verification (should run in ~5 minutes)\n\nPILOT:\n- Generate 5 template environments (2-6 objects)\n- Use all 5 manual baseline environments\n- Run 10 episodes per environment\n- Maximum 25 steps per episode\n- Use training seeds for generation, dev seeds for evaluation\n- Purpose: Initial results assessment (~1 hour runtime)\n\nFULL_EXPERIMENT:\n- Generate 20 template environments (2-6 objects)\n- Use all 5 manual baseline environments\n- Run 50 episodes per environment\n- Maximum 50 steps per episode\n- Use training/dev/test sets appropriately\n- Purpose: Final results (DO NOT RUN in pilot phase)\n\nREQUIRED OUTPUT:\n1. Environment definitions (JSON)\n2. Agent trajectories (JSON)\n3. Performance metrics:\n   - Success rate per environment\n   - Average steps to completion\n   - Valid actions per state\n4. Statistical comparisons:\n   - Bootstrap resampling results\n   - P-values for template vs manual comparison\n5. Performance plots:\n   - Success rate comparison\n   - Steps to completion comparison\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n1. Start with MINI_PILOT mode\n2. If successful, run PILOT mode\n3. Stop after PILOT mode (do not run FULL_EXPERIMENT)\n4. Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls\n5. Log all major steps and results\n6. Save all environment definitions and results as JSON\n\nERROR HANDLING:\n1. Implement robust error checking in environment generation\n2. Validate all environment definitions before use\n3. Handle agent failure cases gracefully\n4.

Both experiments were run in PILOT mode with 5 template-generated and 5 manual environments, with 10 episodes per environment type.\n\nThe first experiment (copy1) showed identical perfect performance (100% success rate) for both template and manual environments, with nearly identical average steps to completion (1.02 vs 1.0 steps). Bootstrap analysis confirmed no significant difference between conditions (p=1.0). However, the perfect performance suggests the environments may have been too simple to differentiate performance.\n\nThe second experiment (copy3) introduced more complexity and showed that manually-designed environments had a slightly higher success rate (74% vs 66%) and required fewer steps on average (9.68 vs 11.06 steps). Importantly, bootstrap analysis revealed these differences were not statistically significant for success rate (p=0.954) and only approached significance for steps required (p=0.069).\n\nCollectively, these results support the hypothesis that template-generated environments can be as playable as manually designed ones. The second experiment provides stronger evidence due to its more challenging environments that better differentiated performance. While template environments may be slightly more challenging in terms of solution efficiency, the lack of statistically significant differences suggests that automated template-based generation is a viable approach for creating playable text game environments.\n\nLimitations include: (1) relatively small sample sizes, (2) testing with only one agent type (ReAct), (3) focus on simple single-room environments, and (4) limited metrics for measuring 'engagement' beyond task completion. Future work should explore more complex environments, diverse agent types, and additional metrics for assessing engagement and playability.",

The experimental agent incorporated sophisticated action selection strategies, including success rate tracking and stuck detection. The experiment was run in PILOT mode with 10 episodes per task and 25 max steps per episode. Results showed the experimental agent significantly outperformed the baseline, achieving a mean score of 5.15 vs 1.15 for baseline (p < 0.001, bootstrap resampling, n=20). The experimental agent showed particular strength in maintaining higher success rates and avoiding repetitive actions. However, both agents still struggled with completing the full tasks, suggesting room for improvement in the LLM guidance strategy. The implementation was notably sophisticated, including detailed logging, proper statistical analysis, and robust error handling."

The original hypothesis specifically predicted that the LLM-guided approach would 'find successful solutions faster' than random exploration. The results present a nuanced picture. In the first experiment (copy4), the LLM-guided agent achieved significantly higher scores on both tasks (thermometer: 11.4 vs 3.0, p<0.001; boiling: 2.1 vs 0.9, p=0.051), demonstrating better task performance. However, it actually took more steps on average to complete tasks (thermometer: 19.1 vs 8.6; boiling: 17.8 vs 11.7), directly contradicting the 'faster' aspect of the hypothesis. The second experiment (copy5) showed the experimental agent significantly outperforming the baseline in overall score (5.15 vs 1.15, p<0.001), but did not provide specific information about steps-to-completion, making it inconclusive regarding the speed hypothesis. Overall, these experiments suggest that while LLM-guided affordance prediction may improve task performance and success rates, it does not necessarily lead to faster solution discovery as originally hypothesized. The experimental agent appears to be more thorough in its exploration, taking more deliberate steps that ultimately lead to higher scores but not necessarily in fewer steps. This suggests a potential trade-off between exploration efficiency (fewer steps) and task effectiveness (higher scores). Future research might focus on optimizing the balance between thorough exploration and efficient task completion.",

Two experiments (copy2 and copy5) directly refuted it, showing the action-tracking agent performed similarly or slightly worse than the standard ReAct agent without statistical significance. The other two experiments were inconclusive - copy3 lacked a crucial ReAct baseline comparison, while copy4 showed no significant performance improvement but did reveal potential secondary benefits in consistency (lower standard deviation) and efficiency (lower action repetition).\n\nConsistently across experiments, both intelligent agents (ReAct and Action-Tracking ReAct) significantly outperformed random baselines, confirming the value of structured reasoning approaches. However, the addition of explicit action outcome tracking did not consistently improve performance beyond standard ReAct capabilities.\n\nInterestingly, experiment copy4 suggested that while action tracking may not improve absolute performance, it might lead to more consistent behavior (lower variability) and more efficient exploration (lower action repetition). This points to potential benefits beyond raw performance metrics that could be valuable in certain applications.\n\nLimitations include the relatively small sample sizes (20 episodes per experiment in PILOT mode) and potential implementation differences across experiments. Future work might explore more sophisticated action tracking mechanisms, different environment complexities, or longer-term learning across episodes to better leverage historical action outcomes.",

This experiment had a notably permissive filtering mechanism that only rejected 2.4% of generated subgoals. In contrast, another experiment showed modest benefits from filtering, with the filtered agent achieving higher completion rates (40% vs 30%) and better scores (0.625 vs 0.5) while filtering out 24% of subgoals. The third experiment showed a higher success rate for the filtered agent (50% vs 40%) but no statistically significant differences in performance metrics for successful episodes, making its results inconclusive. A key observation across experiments is that filtering effectiveness appears correlated with the proportion of subgoals filtered - when the filter was more selective (filtering 24-33% of subgoals), performance tended to improve or stay similar, while overly permissive filtering (2.4%) was associated with worse performance. All experiments used small sample sizes (10 episodes each) in PILOT mode, limiting statistical power. The mixed results suggest that LLM-based subgoal filtering can potentially improve performance, but its effectiveness depends on implementation details, particularly the stringency of the filtering criteria. Future work should investigate optimal filtering thresholds, use larger sample sizes, and explore more sophisticated evaluation criteria beyond the 1-5 scale used in these experiments.",

All conditions achieved 100% success rate across all tasks, but with varying efficiency. For the find_key task, average steps were: baseline_single=2.2, baseline_independent=1.2, shared=1.6. For sequence tasks: baseline_single=4.6, baseline_independent=2.8, shared=5.8. For goal_state tasks: baseline_single=2.8, baseline_independent=3.2, shared=3.6. Statistical analysis using bootstrap resampling showed no significant differences between conditions (p=1.0). Notably, the shared knowledge condition did not improve performance and sometimes required more steps, though this may be due to the small sample size (5 episodes) and the relatively simple nature of the tasks where knowledge sharing might not provide substantial benefits.

The experiments used similar designs with three conditions (single agent baseline, two independent agents, two agents with shared knowledge) across three task types (key finding, sequence execution, goal state achievement).\n\nResults were mixed across the experiments. Two experiments (copy4 and copy5) provided support for the hypothesis, showing clear benefits of knowledge sharing in terms of success rates and efficiency, particularly for complex tasks like goal-state achievement and sequence execution. One experiment (copy3) refuted the hypothesis, with independent agents consistently outperforming shared-knowledge agents across all tasks, though all conditions achieved 100% success. One experiment (copy1) was inconclusive, with mixed results across different tasks and no clear advantage for shared knowledge.\n\nSeveral factors may explain these inconsistencies. First, the experiments were run in PILOT mode with small sample sizes (5 episodes per condition), limiting statistical power. Second, task difficulty varied across implementations - in some cases, tasks may have been too simple to benefit from knowledge sharing. Third, the implementation details of the knowledge sharing mechanism likely differed between experiments.\n\nThe strongest evidence for knowledge sharing benefits appeared in more complex tasks (goal-state achievement) and when baseline performance was not already at ceiling. When tasks were simple enough for independent agents to achieve perfect or near-perfect performance, the overhead of knowledge sharing sometimes resulted in reduced efficiency.\n\nOverall, the meta-analysis suggests that knowledge sharing between agents can be beneficial under certain conditions, particularly for complex tasks where information exchange is critical. However, the benefits are not universal and may depend on task complexity, implementation details, and the specific information being shared. Future research should use larger sample sizes, ensure sufficient task complexity to benefit from information sharing, and standardize knowledge sharing implementations across experiments.",

Each experiment implemented the same basic design with 10 episodes (5 KG, 5 baseline) of 10 steps each, using seeds 1-5 and a consistent environment setup (2 rooms, 3 objects, no doors, unlimited inventory). Three experiments (copies 1, 3, and 4) showed statistically significant support for the hypothesis, with KG representations outperforming text-only baselines by margins ranging from 2.4 to 36.3 percentage points in overall accuracy. One experiment (copy 5) directly contradicted the hypothesis, with the baseline outperforming KG representations by substantial margins in both location tracking (17.7 percentage points) and property tracking (19.3 percentage points). One experiment (copy 2) showed mixed results, with KG representations performing better for location tracking but worse for property tracking. The inconsistency across experiments suggests that implementation details or random variations may significantly impact performance. The small sample size in each pilot (5 episodes per condition) limits the strength of conclusions. Future work should investigate why KG representations sometimes underperform, particularly for property tracking, and should include larger-scale testing with more episodes and diverse environment configurations. Overall, while the evidence leans toward supporting the hypothesis (3 supporting vs 1 refuting), the contradictory results highlight the need for more robust testing and careful consideration of when and how KG representations provide benefits for state tracking.",

Three experiments provided support for the hypothesis, while one was inconclusive.\n\nAll experiments successfully implemented the planned methodology, using gpt-4o-mini to detect functional similarities between object pairs in cooking scenarios and visualizing these relationships in graph format. The experiments consistently found substantial numbers of metaphorical relationships (ranging from 6.2 to 84.4 per scenario) that were generally coherent and contextually appropriate for cooking environments.\n\nThe experiments demonstrated that the LLM could identify plausible functional metaphors (e.g., 'Both provide heat for cooking food' between oven and stove) while sometimes appropriately responding 'None' for pairs without clear functional relationships. The relationships were successfully visualized as edges in knowledge graphs, fulfilling the second part of the hypothesis.\n\nHowever, some methodological limitations were noted. One experiment (copy4) found metaphorical relationships between 100% of co-occurring object pairs, raising questions about the discriminative power of the metaphor detection system. Additionally, while random baselines were implemented, detailed comparative analyses were limited. Most importantly, none of the experiments included the planned human evaluation of relationship quality, which was specified in the original research idea.\n\nThe high proportion of detected relationships across experiments (approaching 100% in some cases) suggests either strong interconnectedness of kitchen objects or potential over-generalization by the LLM. Without human evaluation to validate the quality of these relationships, it's difficult to fully assess whether all detected relationships were truly meaningful.\n\nDespite these limitations, the weight of evidence across the four experiments supports the hypothesis that an LLM can identify meaningful metaphorical relationships between objects based on functional similarities and visualize these in a knowledge graph format. Future work should incorporate human evaluation of relationship quality to strengthen these findings.",

ENVIRONMENT SETUP\n- Use TextWorldExpress cooking tasks with simplified parameters:\n  * numLocations=3 (small environment)\n  * includeDoors=0 (no doors)\n  * limitInventorySize=0 (unlimited inventory)\n  * numDistractorItems=2 (minimal distractors)\n- Vary numIngredients based on PILOT_MODE (1 for MINI_PILOT, 1-2 for PILOT, 1-3 for FULL_EXPERIMENT)\n\n3. AGENT IMPLEMENTATIONS\nImplement three agent types:\na) Subgoal-Based ReAct Agent:\n- Use gpt-4o-mini to decompose the main task into subgoals\n- Prompt the LLM with the task description and ask it to break it down into ordered subgoals\n- Example prompt: \"Break down the cooking task '{task_description}' into a sequence of specific subgoals. Format as a JSON list of strings.\"\n- Inject each subgoal into the ReAct agent's prompt one at a time\n\nb) Direct ReAct Agent (Baseline 1):\n- Use the same base ReAct agent but without subgoal decomposition\n- Give it the full task description directly\n\nc) Random Agent (Baseline 2):\n- Randomly select from valid actions at each step\n\n4. DATA COLLECTION\nFor each episode, record:\n- Task description and complexity (num ingredients)\n- For subgoal agent: list of generated subgoals\n- Full action trajectory\n- Step-by-step scores\n- Final score\n- Completion status\n- Total steps taken\n- Time taken\n\n5. ANALYSIS\nFor each pilot mode:\na) Calculate per-condition metrics:\n- Average score\n- Score progression over steps (for plotting)\n- Average number of steps taken\n- Task completion rate (based on score thresholds)\n\nb) Statistical Analysis:\n- Use bootstrap resampling to compare:\n  * Subgoal vs Direct planning\n  * Both vs Random baseline\n- Analyze per recipe complexity (1, 2, or 3 ingredients)\n\nc) Generate plots:\n- Score progression over steps for each condition\n- Performance comparison across recipe complexities\n\n6. EXECUTION ORDER\n1. Start with MINI_PILOT mode\n2. If successful, proceed to PILOT mode\n3. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT (requires manual verification)\n\n7. OUTPUT\nGenerate a results.json file containing:\n- All configuration parameters\n- Raw episode data\n- Summary statistics\n- Bootstrap analysis results\n\nGenerate plots saved as PDFs:\n- score_progression.pdf\n- complexity_comparison.pdf\n\nAll experiment progress, errors, and results should be logged using the Logger.\n\nNOTE: Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls as specified in the special conditioning instructions.",

The experiment should be implemented in three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, and FULL_EXPERIMENT), controlled by a global PILOT_MODE variable.\n\nEnvironment Setup:\n1. Use TextWorldExpress CookingWorld with these parameters:\n   - MINI_PILOT: numLocations=3, numIngredients=2, numDistractorItems=2, includeDoors=0\n   - PILOT: numLocations=5, numIngredients=3, numDistractorItems=5, includeDoors=0\n   - FULL_EXPERIMENT: Default parameters\n\nData Collection Phase:\n2. Collect successful trajectories using random exploration with valid action filtering:\n   - MINI_PILOT: 2 successful trajectories, max 25 steps each\n   - PILOT: 5 successful trajectories, max 50 steps each\n   - FULL_EXPERIMENT: 20 successful trajectories, max 100 steps each\n\nTemplate Discovery:\n3. Extract and store two-action templates:\n   - For each successful trajectory, extract all consecutive pairs of actions\n   - Keep pairs that appear more than once across trajectories\n   - Store templates as (action1, action2) tuples\n   - Log the number of unique templates discovered\n\nAgent Implementation:\n4. Implement three agents:\n   a) Template Agent:\n      - First checks if any template's first action matches a current valid action\n      - If yes, attempts to use that template\n      - If template's second action isn't valid when attempted, fall back to random valid action\n      - If no template applies, select random valid action\n      - Log template usage (successful/failed attempts)\n   b) Random Baseline Agent (use existing from TextWorldExpress)\n   c) Primitive Action Agent (random selection from valid actions)\n\nEvaluation Phase:\n5. Test each agent on new episodes:\n   - MINI_PILOT: 3 episodes, max 25 steps each\n   - PILOT: 10 episodes, max 50 steps each\n   - FULL_EXPERIMENT: 50 episodes, max 100 steps each\n\nMetrics to Track:\n6. For each episode:\n   - Score at each step (0-1 range)\n   - Final score\n   - Number of steps taken\n   - For template agent: template usage statistics\n\nAnalysis:\n7. Compare performance using bootstrap resampling:\n   - Compare template agent vs each baseline separately\n   - Use score differences as input to bootstrap\n   - Report p-values and significance\n\nLogging Requirements:\n8. Log the following:\n   - Full trajectories (observation, score, valid actions, chosen action at each step)\n   - Discovered templates\n   - Template usage statistics\n   - Performance metrics\n   - Bootstrap analysis results\n\nOutput Requirements:\n9. Generate a results.json file containing:\n   - Environment parameters\n   - Number of templates discovered\n   - Performance metrics for each agent\n   - Statistical comparison results\n   - Template usage statistics\n\nNotes:\n- Use gpt-4o-mini for any LLM calls\n- Run MINI_PILOT first, then if successful, run PILOT\n- Stop after PILOT (human verification required before FULL_EXPERIMENT)\n- Log all errors and warnings appropriately\n- Include clear status messages for each phase of the experiment",

FULL_EXPERIMENT: 50 training episodes and 25 test episodes, max 100 steps per episode\n\nImplementation Steps:\n\n1. Environment Setup:\n- Use TextWorldExpress API with CookingWorld environment\n- Parameters: numLocations=3, numIngredients=2, numDistractorItems=2, includeDoors=0\n- Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls\n\n2. Pattern Storage System:\n- Create a PatternStore class that saves patterns as JSON files\n- Each pattern should contain: initial observation, goal, sequence of reasoning steps that led to score increases\n- Store patterns when score increases occur (last 5 steps before each score increase)\n\n3. Pattern Matcher:\n- Implement simple text similarity matching using scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer\n- Match threshold: 0.7 (configurable)\n- Compare current observation/goal with stored patterns\n\n4. Modified ReAct Agent:\n- Extend the ReAct Agent Example\n- Before each 'think' step, check for matching patterns\n- If match found, adapt the matching pattern's reasoning chain\n- If no match or adaptation fails, fall back to standard reasoning\n\n5. Experiment Structure:\n- First run training episodes, collecting patterns\n- Then run test episodes with both agents (pattern-reuse and baseline)\n- Log all steps, scores, pattern matches, and outcomes\n\n6. Metrics to Track:\n- Primary: Score progression over steps\n- Secondary: (1) Average steps per score increase, (2) Pattern reuse rate\n- Log when patterns are stored and reused\n\n7. Analysis and Visualization:\n- Generate learning curves (score vs. steps) for both agents\n- Calculate and plot pattern reuse statistics\n- Use bootstrap resampling to compare performance\n\nOutput Requirements:\n1. Save all patterns to 'patterns.json'\n2. Generate plots:\n   - 'learning_curves.pdf': Score vs. steps for both agents\n   - 'pattern_reuse.pdf': Pattern reuse statistics\n3. Save detailed logs including:\n   - All agent steps and scores\n   - Pattern storage events\n   - Pattern reuse events\n   - Performance metrics\n\nRun the MINI_PILOT first. If successful, run the PILOT. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT for human verification.\n\nNote: Use the logger to track all major events and any errors. All LLM calls must use gpt-4o-mini through the proxy server.",

The results consistently showed that the self-evaluating ReAct agent outperformed both the standard ReAct agent and the random baseline across multiple metrics, including average score, task completion rate, and average steps to completion. In the first experiment, the self-evaluating agent achieved a mean score of 0.22 (vs 0.168 for standard ReAct) and was the only agent to complete any tasks (1/25 episodes), though these differences were not statistically significant (p=0.164).

Configure for 3 rooms, no doors (includeDoors=0)\n3. Restrict to 1-ingredient recipes only (numIngredients=1)\n4. Set numDistractorItems=2\n\nAgent Implementation:\n1. Create two agents:\n   a. Experimental Agent (with decomposition history):\n      - Extend the ReAct agent to store successful subtrajectories (sequences where score increases)\n      - Store these in a JSON file as {'task_desc': str, 'observation': str, 'decomposition': list[str], 'score_increase': float}\n      - When facing a new task, use difflib.SequenceMatcher to find similar past tasks (similarity > 0.7)\n      - If a similar task exists, use its decomposition pattern\n   b. Baseline Agent:\n      - Standard ReAct agent without decomposition history\n\nBoth agents should:\n- Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls\n- Use separate prompts for 'think' and 'act' steps\n- Maximum 50 steps per episode\n\nPilot Modes:\n1. MINI_PILOT:\n   - Train: 2 episodes (seeds 1-2)\n   - Test: 2 episodes (seeds 3-4)\n   - Max steps: 25 per episode\n\n2. PILOT:\n   - Train: 5 episodes (seeds 1-5)\n   - Test: 5 episodes (seeds 6-10)\n   - Max steps: 50 per episode\n\n3. FULL_EXPERIMENT:\n   - Train: 50 episodes (seeds 1-50)\n   - Test: 25 episodes (seeds 51-75)\n   - Max steps: 50 per episode\n\nNote: Only run MINI_PILOT first, then if successful, run PILOT. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT.\n\nMetrics to Track:\n1. Primary:\n   - Score progression over steps\n   - Final score per episode\n   - Average steps to reach score increases\n2. Secondary:\n   - Pattern reuse rate (experimental agent only)\n   - Number of stored patterns\n\nLogging Requirements:\n1. Each episode should log:\n   - Full trajectory (observation, score, valid actions, chosen action)\n   - Think/Act steps from ReAct\n   - Pattern matching decisions (experimental agent)\n   - Score changes\n2. Save decomposition history after each episode\n\nAnalysis:\n1. Use bootstrap resampling to compare:\n   - Final scores between conditions\n   - Average steps to score increases\n2. Plot:\n   - Score progression over steps\n   - Pattern reuse rate vs. episode number\n\nOutput Requirements:\n1. results.json with all metrics\n2. patterns.json with stored decomposition patterns\n3. logs/ directory with per-episode logs\n4. analysis.json with statistical comparisons\n\nImplementation Notes:\n1. Use string similarity from difflib.SequenceMatcher\n2. Store patterns in simple JSON format\n3. Focus on score increases rather than task completion\n4. Log all LLM calls and their costs",

The baseline agent achieved higher scores and more frequent score increases during both training and testing. Notably, during testing, the experimental agent failed to score in 2/5 episodes, while the baseline failed in 1/5. The implementation appeared technically sound but may have suffered from the small sample size of the pilot study and potential issues with the pattern matching threshold (0.7) being too restrictive.

None of the experiments provided strong support for the hypothesis. One experiment (copy2) directly refuted it, with the experimental agent performing worse than the baseline (0.14 vs 0.26 mean test scores). The other two experiments (copy1 and copy3) showed small, non-significant improvements in the experimental condition but were deemed inconclusive. A consistent finding across all experiments was the low or zero pattern reuse rate, suggesting that while the pattern storage mechanism was implemented successfully, the agents failed to effectively reuse these patterns. This may be attributed to the strict similarity matching threshold (0.7) being too restrictive, insufficient training episodes to build a useful pattern library, or fundamental limitations in the string matching approach to pattern identification. All experiments were conducted in PILOT mode with small sample sizes (5 training and 5 test episodes), limiting statistical power. The meta-analysis suggests that simple string-matching approaches to decomposition memory may be insufficient, and future work should consider more sophisticated pattern matching algorithms, lower similarity thresholds, larger training sets, or alternative approaches to representing and retrieving task decompositions.",

Each experiment implemented the same basic design with three conditions: baseline (random actions), single-agent reflection, and dual-sequential reflection, with 3 tasks and 5 episodes per task in each condition.\n\nThe results across experiments were mixed and largely inconclusive regarding the primary hypothesis. Only one experiment (copy2) showed results supporting the hypothesis, with dual-reflection achieving higher mean scores than single-agent reflection (0.183 vs 0.127), though this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.161). Two experiments (copy1 and copy5) showed results that refuted the hypothesis, with single-agent reflection performing similarly or better than dual-reflection. One experiment (copy4) showed inconclusive results with minimal differences between reflection conditions.\n\nConsistently across all experiments, both reflection conditions tended to outperform the baseline random action condition, suggesting that reflection in general provides some benefit. However, the evidence does not consistently support the specific hypothesis that dual-sequential reflection outperforms single-agent reflection.\n\nKey limitations across all experiments include small sample sizes (15 episodes per condition), which limited statistical power to detect potentially real but modest effects. Additionally, the use of random actions rather than more sophisticated action selection strategies may have constrained the potential benefits of reflection.\n\nIn conclusion, while reflection appears beneficial compared to no reflection, the current evidence does not strongly support the hypothesis that sequential two-agent reflection generates better insights than single-agent reflection in these cooking tasks. Future research should consider larger sample sizes, more sophisticated action selection strategies, and potentially different task domains to further investigate potential benefits of multi-agent reflection.",

However, since no experiment results were provided, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the hypothesis that a two-level hierarchical belief structure leads to more organized and complete knowledge representation compared to a flat belief structure.",

Results showed that the detailed mode performed best (100% success rate, score=67 for all episodes), followed by the knowledge graph approach (80% success rate, mean score=33.6), random switching (40% success rate, mean score=-33.2), and quick mode (0% success rate, score=-100 for all episodes).

Results showed the always-detailed mode performed best (mean score 71.8), followed by knowledge-graph (16.8), random (-16.6), and always-quick (-53.2).

One experiment (copy5) strongly supported the hypothesis, showing the knowledge graph approach achieving a 100% success rate and significantly outperforming both random and always-detailed modes. However, another experiment (copy4) refuted the hypothesis, with the knowledge graph approach performing significantly worse than the always-detailed mode, suggesting the hypothesized benefits of dynamic mode switching were not realized. The third experiment (copy3) yielded inconclusive results, with the knowledge graph approach performing better than random and quick modes but worse than the detailed mode, while showing promise in balancing performance and efficiency. All experiments were conducted as pilot studies with only 5 episodes per condition, limiting the strength of conclusions. The inconsistency across experiments suggests that the effectiveness of knowledge graph-based mode switching may be sensitive to implementation details or task characteristics.

Knowledge Graph Agent:\n   - Extend the ReAct agent template to include knowledge graph maintenance\n   - Store graph in DOT format with three node types: objects, properties, hypotheses\n   - Edge types should include: has_property, related_to, supports, contradicts\n   - After each observation/action, update graph and save as both .dot and .pdf\n   - Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls\n\n2. Experiment Configuration:\nMINI_PILOT:\n   - Task: Proteomics-Easy only\n   - Seeds: 0-1 only\n   - Max steps per episode: 20\n   - Save graphs every 5 steps\n\nPILOT:\n   - Tasks: Proteomics-Easy, Chemistry-Easy\n   - Seeds: 0-4\n   - Max steps per episode: 50\n   - Save graphs every 10 steps\n\nFULL_EXPERIMENT:\n   - All DiscoveryWorld tasks\n   - Seeds: 0-9\n   - Max steps per episode: Task-dependent (use DiscoveryWorld defaults)\n   - Save graphs every 20 steps\n\n3. Metrics to Track:\n   - Primary: Task completion rate, Task process score, Explanatory knowledge score\n   - Secondary: Number of nodes/edges over time, Graph update frequency\n   - Log all metrics after each episode\n\n4. Analysis Requirements:\n   - Generate line plots comparing metrics between conditions\n   - Use bootstrap resampling to test for significant differences\n   - Save all raw data as JSON for future analysis\n\n5. Implementation Steps:\na) First implement the knowledge graph maintenance:\n   - Initialize empty graph\n   - Add nodes for observed objects/properties\n   - Add edges for relationships\n   - Add hypothesis nodes when agent makes predictions\n   - Update graph based on experimental results\n\nb) Then implement the agent's decision making:\n   - Modify ReAct agent's think step to consider graph state\n   - Add graph visualization to logging\n   - Track graph-based metrics\n\nc) Finally implement evaluation:\n   - Run both agents (baseline ReAct and knowledge graph)\n   - Compare performance using bootstrap resampling\n   - Generate plots of metrics over time\n\n6. Required Directory Structure:\n   /graphs/         - Store .dot and .pdf files\n   /metrics/        - Store performance metrics\n   /analysis/       - Store statistical analyses\n   /logs/           - Store detailed logs\n\n7. Logging Requirements:\n   - Log all observations, actions, graph updates\n   - Log metrics after each episode\n   - Log statistical analyses\n   - Save graphs as both .dot and .pdf\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n1. Start with MINI_PILOT mode to verify basic functionality\n2. Only proceed to PILOT after MINI_PILOT shows correct behavior\n3. Stop after PILOT - do not run FULL_EXPERIMENT (this requires manual verification)\n4. Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls to minimize costs\n5. Implement appropriate error handling and logging throughout\n\nExpected Output:\n1. Trained agents (baseline and knowledge graph)\n2. Performance metrics and statistical analyses\n3. Visualizations of metrics and graphs\n4. Detailed logs of agent behavior\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n1. Both agents run without errors\n2. Metrics are properly tracked and logged\n3.

All three experiments showed a consistent pattern: the knowledge graph agents achieved slightly higher mean scores (improvements ranging from 0.042 to 0.100 points), but none of these differences reached statistical significance (p-values ranged from 0.17 to 0.322). The experiments varied in their findings regarding efficiency: one found the knowledge graph agent took more steps, another found it took fewer steps, and the third didn't clearly report step differences. The knowledge graphs successfully tracked environmental information (growing from 8-44 nodes and 10-306 edges across episodes), demonstrating that the technical implementation worked as intended. However, this environmental tracking did not translate to statistically significant performance improvements. All experiments used relatively small sample sizes (5-10 episodes), limiting statistical power. Technical challenges were noted in at least one experiment regarding graph parsing and invalid action selection. Overall, these pilot experiments suggest that knowledge graph integration may provide a small benefit to ReAct agents, but the current implementations and sample sizes are insufficient to draw strong conclusions about the hypothesis. A full-scale experiment with larger sample sizes, potentially refined knowledge graph integration, and more complex environments might better reveal whether the approach offers significant advantages.",
