The experiment compared three agent types: a random baseline, a standard ReAct agent, and a knowledge-augmented ReAct agent. The results clearly showed that both ReAct variants significantly outperformed the random baseline (p<0.001), demonstrating the effectiveness of the ReAct approach in general. However, the key finding was that there was no significant difference between the standard ReAct and knowledge-augmented ReAct agents (p=0.5321), with both achieving identical mean scores of 0.5625. This directly refutes the hypothesis that adding ConceptNet knowledge retrieval would improve performance. The implementation details suggest a potential issue with the knowledge integration mechanism, as empty knowledge retrievals were reported in the results. This could indicate that while the knowledge retrieval component was technically implemented, it may not have been effectively utilized in the agent's decision-making process. It's worth noting that the experiment was conducted in PILOT mode with a relatively small sample size (20 episodes per task), which could limit statistical power. However, the identical performance metrics between the two ReAct variants strongly suggest that, at least in this implementation, adding ConceptNet knowledge did not provide any performance advantage. Future work might explore more effective ways to integrate external knowledge into ReAct agents or investigate whether such knowledge augmentation might be more beneficial with simpler base LLMs that have less knowledge already embedded in their parameters.",

The agent also showed difficulty with basic actions like picking up containers. Statistical comparisons showed no significant differences between strategies (all p=1.0).

The experiment tested four strategies: time-based pruning (removing oldest memories), frequency-based pruning (removing least-used memories), no pruning, and random pruning. The original hypothesis predicted that frequency-based pruning would outperform time-based pruning. Results showed a slight numerical advantage for frequency-based pruning (avg score 0.8) over time-based pruning (avg score 0.7), which directionally aligns with the hypothesis. However, this difference was not statistically significant (p=1.0), and both experimental strategies were outperformed by the baselines (no pruning: 1.5, random pruning: 0.9). The experiment encountered significant implementation challenges, including LLM cost limit exceedances that caused agent failures and difficulties with basic action execution. These technical issues severely compromise the reliability of the results. Given these limitations and the lack of statistical significance, the evidence is insufficient to either support or refute the hypothesis. Additional experiments with more robust implementation, larger sample sizes, and successful completion of all planned episodes would be necessary to draw meaningful conclusions about the relative effectiveness of these memory pruning strategies.",

Three of the four experiments (75%) provided statistically significant evidence supporting the hypothesis that goal-tracking agents perform better than random exploration, while one experiment showed a non-significant trend in the same direction. All experiments were conducted in PILOT mode with 5 games and 5 episodes each, using similar implementations of a ReAct agent that maintained confidence scores for different cooking goals ('cook meal', 'prepare breakfast', 'make dinner', 'cook recipe'). The successful experiments showed statistically significant improvements in game scores: copy1 (0.334 vs 0.128, p<0.001), copy4 (0.127 vs 0.055, p=0.033), and copy5 (0.198 vs 0.074, p<0.001). The inconclusive experiment (copy3) showed a smaller, non-significant difference (0.147 vs 0.134, p=0.323). Despite the positive results, all experiments noted limitations including the small sample size of the pilot testing and occasional agent inefficiencies such as getting stuck in repetitive behavior patterns. The absolute performance of both agent types remained relatively low across all experiments, suggesting room for further improvement in the goal-tracking mechanism and action selection strategies. Overall, the meta-analysis provides moderately strong evidence that explicitly tracking predefined cooking-related goal hypotheses improves agent performance compared to random exploration in cooking games, though the magnitude of improvement varies across implementations.",

The experiments that supported the hypothesis demonstrated that certain metrics (particularly Jaccard similarity in one case and custom metrics incorporating structural features in two others) could significantly outperform random baselines, achieving similarity scores between 0.3-0.8. However, two experiments found that basic metrics performed poorly or even worse than random chance, with very low similarity scores (below 0.1) and no positive correlation with game progress. The contradictory results may be explained by differences in implementation details, particularly in how graphs were constructed and how similarity was calculated. The more successful experiments tended to use more sophisticated metrics that incorporated structural graph features beyond simple word overlap. This suggests that while basic similarity metrics alone may be insufficient, enhanced metrics that account for graph structure can effectively align text and graph representations. The experiments were limited by focusing primarily on initial game states rather than full trajectories and using relatively simple graph constructions. Future work should standardize graph construction methods, explore more sophisticated similarity metrics, and evaluate performance across more diverse game scenarios and complete gameplay trajectories.",

The verification system had a high accuracy rate (79.5%) and detected/corrected a substantial number of incorrect triples (233 corrections out of 1108 total triples). Graph metrics showed differences in structure between conditions, with experimental graphs typically having better precision but fewer edges. The experiment successfully implemented all core requirements including bootstrap resampling for statistical analysis, though some advanced visualization features were not fully implemented."

Results showed the experimental condition achieved higher average scores (0.129 vs 0.075, p=0.059) and more accurate graph representations (82.4% verification rate, with 197 correct vs 42 incorrect verifications). The experimental condition produced more focused graphs (avg 2.4 nodes vs 4.3 nodes) with higher density (0.152 vs 0.036). While not reaching traditional statistical significance, the trending performance difference and improved graph metrics suggest LLM verification may help create more accurate and focused knowledge representations. Key limitations include the small sample size (10 episodes), random action selection rather than goal-directed behavior, and lack of direct graph accuracy evaluation against ground truth."

Three experiments provided support for the hypothesis, while one was inconclusive due to execution failure. The successful experiments consistently showed that LLM verification detected and corrected graph inconsistencies, with correction rates ranging from 10.4 per episode to 233 corrections out of 1108 total triples. Verification accuracy was high (79.5-82.4%) across experiments. Game performance metrics showed consistent improvement with verification: scores were 0.125 vs 0.077 (p=0.155), 0.152 vs 0.067 (p=0.001), and 0.129 vs 0.075 (p=0.059) for the three successful experiments. Only one experiment achieved traditional statistical significance (p<0.05), but all showed positive trends. Graph structure analysis revealed that verified graphs tended to be more focused (fewer nodes) with higher density and better precision. Limitations across experiments included small sample sizes (10 episodes), use of random actions rather than learned policies, and lack of direct graph accuracy evaluation against ground truth. Overall, the evidence strongly suggests that LLM-based verification improves knowledge graph quality in text-based games, resulting in more accurate, focused representations that correlate with improved game performance.",

The results across experiments were mixed, with one experiment supporting the hypothesis and two refuting it. In experiment copy3, the Planning agent significantly outperformed the ReAct baseline in both task score (0.363 vs 0.273, p=0.0046) and efficiency (15.85 vs 22.45 steps). However, in experiments copy2 and copy5, the Planning agent did not demonstrate superior performance compared to the ReAct baseline. In copy2, there was no significant difference in task scores (0.188 vs 0.197, p=0.715), though the Planning agent used fewer steps. In copy5, the ReAct agent actually outperformed the Planning agent in both task score (0.210 vs 0.167) and efficiency (14.35 vs 23.60 steps). All three experiments consistently showed that both Planning and ReAct agents significantly outperformed the Random baseline. The inconsistency across experiments suggests that the effectiveness of the planning approach may be sensitive to implementation details, environment configurations, or the specific nature of the tasks. It's worth noting that all experiments were conducted in PILOT mode with only 20 episodes, which limits statistical power. Future research should consider larger sample sizes, more diverse tasks, and potential refinements to the planning mechanism to better understand when and how planning provides advantages in this domain.",

The environments tested were also relatively simple (3-4 rooms), which may not have provided sufficient complexity to demonstrate the hypothesized advantages of hierarchical filtering.\n\nOverall, the evidence leans against the hypothesis, with two experiments refuting it, one supporting it, and one being inconclusive.

The experimental agent also showed more efficient exploration, visiting more unique locations per episode (1.72 vs 1.76 locations) in fewer average steps (17.8 vs 24.9 steps).

However, there was no significant difference in steps taken (experimental mean=18.83, baseline mean=19.42, p=0.524). The experiment was faithfully implemented according to the pilot specifications, with proper environment setup, data collection, and statistical analysis using bootstrap resampling.

Both experiments implemented a similar design with 25 episodes comparing baseline and experimental conditions. The first experiment showed clear support for the hypothesis, with the location-tracking agent achieving both higher scores (0.38 vs 0.28) and requiring fewer steps (17.8 vs 24.9) on average. The second experiment found a statistically significant improvement in task scores (0.328 vs 0.158, p=0.015) but no significant difference in steps taken (18.83 vs 19.42, p=0.524). Across both experiments, the location-tracking agent consistently achieved higher task scores, suggesting improved overall performance. However, the evidence for improved efficiency specifically in terms of steps required is mixed. The first experiment showed a substantial reduction in steps, while the second showed no significant difference. This inconsistency may be due to the small sample sizes (25 episodes each), differences in implementation details, or the high variance typical in reinforcement learning tasks. Overall, the results suggest that location tracking is a promising enhancement for ReAct agents in TextWorldExpress cooking games, consistently improving task performance and potentially improving efficiency, though more extensive experiments with larger sample sizes would be needed to draw stronger conclusions about step efficiency specifically.",

The study implemented a PILOT mode with 20 episodes, examining LLM predictions about state changes in a cooking-themed environment. The experiment successfully collected confidence-accuracy pairs across episodes, finding a moderate positive correlation (mean correlation \u2248 0.587) between LLM's confidence scores and actual prediction accuracy. The implementation included proper environment setup, state tracking, and confidence scoring, though some deviations from the original specification occurred in the analysis phase. The results suggest that LLMs can somewhat calibrate their confidence scores to match their prediction accuracy, though the correlation is not strong enough to be fully reliable. Notable limitations include the relatively small sample size and the simplified environment configuration."

The experiment was implemented mostly faithfully to the specification, including proper environment setup, data collection, and statistical analysis. However, there were some deviations in the implementation of accuracy scoring and confidence assessment, and the log shows occasional errors in LLM responses that required retries.

All experiments used similar methodology: running multiple episodes in CookingWorld environments where an LLM (gpt-4o-mini) made state predictions with confidence scores, which were then compared to actual outcomes. The results show a consistent pattern of positive but variable correlation between confidence and accuracy. Two experiments provided clear support for the hypothesis, finding moderate positive correlations (r\u22480.587 and r=0.33) between confidence scores and accuracy. Three experiments yielded inconclusive results, showing either very weak correlations (r=0.110) or highly inconsistent correlations that varied widely across episodes (ranging from strongly negative to strongly positive). No experiment definitively refuted the hypothesis. The meta-analysis suggests that LLMs do possess some metacognitive ability to assess their prediction confidence, with confidence scores showing a generally positive correlation with accuracy. However, this relationship is inconsistent and often too weak to be practically reliable for identifying incorrect predictions. The high variability in correlations across episodes indicates that LLM confidence calibration is context-dependent and unstable. These findings suggest that while confidence scores may provide some signal about prediction accuracy, they cannot be relied upon as a robust mechanism for identifying potentially incorrect predictions without additional safeguards or improvements in LLM calibration.",

Use `gpt-4o-mini` for all LLM calls to minimize costs\n2. Implement three pilot modes (set via PILOT_MODE global variable):\n   - MINI_PILOT: 2 episodes, max 20 steps each, training set only\n   - PILOT: 10 episodes, max 50 steps each, using training set (8 episodes) and dev set (2 episodes)\n   - FULL_EXPERIMENT: 50 episodes each condition, max steps 100, proper train/dev/test split\n   Initially run MINI_PILOT, then if successful, run PILOT. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT.\n\nExperiment Structure:\n1. Knowledge Graph Creation:\n   - Create a small static knowledge graph of cooking relationships\n   - Nodes: ingredients and their states (e.g., 'raw carrot', 'diced carrot')\n   - Edges: valid actions and their results (e.g., 'dice->diced', 'cook->cooked')\n   - Save graph in DOT format and generate PDF visualization\n\n2. ReAct Agent Implementation:\n   - Baseline condition: Standard ReAct agent without graph context\n   - Experimental condition: ReAct agent with relevant subgraph included in prompt\n   - Both use same base prompt template except for graph inclusion\n   - Format for graph context: 'Valid cooking relationships:\\n{subgraph_text}'\n\n3. Environment Configuration:\n   - Use CookingWorld with simplified settings:\n     * numLocations: 3\n     * numIngredients: 2 (MINI_PILOT) / 3 (PILOT/FULL)\n     * numDistractorItems: 1 (MINI_PILOT) / 2 (PILOT/FULL)\n     * includeDoors: 0\n     * limitInventorySize: 1\n\n4. Data Collection:\n   - For each episode, record:\n     * Full trajectory (observations, actions, scores)\n     * Valid action rate\n     * Task completion (success/failure)\n     * Number of steps taken\n     * Time per episode\n   - Save all results in JSON format\n\n5. Analysis:\n   - Primary metrics:\n     * Percentage of valid cooking actions\n     * Task completion rate\n     * Average steps to completion\n   - Generate plots:\n     * Line plot comparing valid action rates over episode steps\n     * Bar plot of completion rates\n   - Statistical comparison using bootstrap resampling\n\nRequired Output:\n1. knowledge_graph.dot and knowledge_graph.pdf\n2. results.json containing all experimental data\n3. performance_comparison.pdf with plots\n4. log.json with detailed execution logs\n\nSpecific Implementation Notes:\n1. Knowledge graph should focus on basic cooking actions:\n   - dice/chop/slice -> creates diced/chopped/sliced versions\n   - cook/fry/bake -> creates cooked/fried/baked versions\n   - combine ingredients -> creates combined dishes\n\n2. ReAct agent prompt template should include:\n   - Task description\n   - Current observation\n   - [Experimental only] Relevant subgraph\n   - Format: 'Think: [reasoning]\\nAct: [action]'\n\n3. Error handling:\n   - Log all LLM calls and responses\n   - Track any invalid actions or failures\n   - Include error recovery in agent loop\n\nSuccess Criteria for Pilot:\n- MINI_PILOT: Basic functionality working, no errors\n- PILOT: Initial indication of performance difference between conditions\n- Both: Clear logging and result collection",

The confidence scores showed a moderate negative correlation with edge verification (-0.44), suggesting that the agent's confidence assessment was not well-calibrated.

One experiment strongly supported the hypothesis, showing the confidence-based agent achieved substantially higher verification rates for knowledge graph edges (77% vs 65% for baseline). However, another experiment refuted the hypothesis, finding no statistically significant difference in verified edges (p=0.2965) and a very weak correlation between confidence scores and edge verification (r=0.033). The third experiment showed results trending toward supporting the hypothesis (0.233 vs 0.166 verified edges, p=0.069) but remained inconclusive due to the small sample size and p-value above conventional significance thresholds. All experiments were conducted in PILOT mode with 10 episodes of 30 steps each in a 3-room environment, providing a consistent testing framework. The inconsistency in results suggests that the effectiveness of confidence-based reasoning may be sensitive to implementation details or evaluation metrics. Two experiments indicated some benefit to confidence-based reasoning (one significantly, one trending), while one showed no benefit. A key limitation across all experiments was the relatively small sample size (10 episodes), which may have limited statistical power. Additionally, the experiments varied in their implementation of confidence scoring and how they measured graph accuracy, which could explain the divergent results. Future work should include larger sample sizes, standardized implementations of confidence reasoning, and more robust statistical analyses to determine whether the observed benefits of confidence-based reasoning are reliable and generalizable.",

Presumably the memory is provided to the ReAct agent in its prompt.  The prompt should also include a past history, so the agent knows what actions it's taken/observations it's seen.  The \"past successes\" are presumably from past episodes, and that memory would need to be retained across episodes. It could be added to during training, but would be static during evaluation on the evaluation set?",
            "operationalization_description": "Please build an experiment to test whether providing a ReAct agent with its past successful experiences improves its reflection process in TextWorldExpress cooking tasks. The experiment should be implemented with three pilot modes (PILOT_MODE should be a global variable):\n\nPILOT MODES:\n1. MINI_PILOT: 2 episodes, 20 steps max per episode, 2 attempts per task, using training set seeds 1-2\n2. PILOT: 10 episodes, 40 steps max per episode, 5 attempts per task, using training seeds 1-5 for training, dev seeds 1-5 for evaluation\n3. FULL_EXPERIMENT: 100 episodes, 100 steps max, 10 attempts per task, full training/dev/test sets\n\nStart with MINI_PILOT. Only proceed to PILOT after successful MINI_PILOT completion. Stop after PILOT completion.\n\nENVIRONMENT SETUP:\n- Use TextWorldExpress cooking tasks\n- Configure: numLocations=3, numIngredients=2, numDistractorItems=2, includeDoors=0\n- Maximum steps per episode as specified in pilot modes\n- Use training set seeds for collecting experiences, dev set for evaluation\n\nAGENT IMPLEMENTATIONS:\n1. Baseline Agent:\n   - Standard ReAct agent without reflection\n   - Uses gpt-4o-mini for think/act steps\n   - Standard prompt template from ReAct example\n\n2. Basic Reflection Agent:\n   - ReAct agent with reflection but no past experiences\n   - On failure (no reward in last 5 steps), generates reflection using template:\n   \"I failed because [reason]. I should modify my approach by [changes].\"\n\n3. Experience-Guided Reflection Agent:\n   - ReAct agent with reflection using past experiences\n   - Store successful experiences (any step that received positive reward)\n   - Experience format (JSON):\n     {\n         \"task_desc\": str,\n         \"observation\": str,\n         \"action_history\": list,\n         \"reward_history\": list,\n         \"final_reward\": float\n     }\n   - On failure, retrieve most similar past experience\n   - Use template: \"In my current attempt, I failed because [reason]. In a similar situation, I succeeded by [successful_approach]. I should modify my approach by [proposed_changes].\"\n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE:\n1. Experience Collection Phase:\n   - Run baseline agent on training seeds\n   - Store any steps that received positive reward\n   - Save experiences to experiences.json\n\n2. Evaluation Phase:\n   - Run all three agents on evaluation seeds\n   - For each episode:\n     * Record full trajectory\n     * Log all reflections\n     * Track rewards, steps, success/failure\n\n3. Analysis:\n   - Primary metrics:\n     * Average reward per episode\n     * Success rate (proportion of episodes with positive reward)\n     * Average steps to first reward\n   - Secondary metrics:\n     * Number of reflections triggered\n     * Average steps per episode\n   - Use bootstrap resampling to compare metrics between agents\n\nLOGGING:\n- Use Logger for all major events\n- Log format for each step:\n  {\n      \"step_idx\": int,\n      \"agent_type\": str,\n      \"observation\": str,\n      \"think\": str,\n      \"action\": str,\n      \"reward\": float,\n      \"reflection\": str (if any)\n  }\n\nOUTPUT:\n1. Summary statistics for each agent\n2. Bootstrap comparison results\n3. Example reflections from both reflection agents\n4. Learning curves (reward vs episode)\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n- Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls\n- Store experiences across episodes but keep static during evaluation\n- Include past history in ReAct prompts (last 5 steps)\n- Focus on reward rather than task completion\n- Run MINI_PILOT first, then PILOT only if successful",

The experiment was designed to collect experiences from training seeds and evaluate all three agents on evaluation seeds, measuring metrics such as average reward, success rate, and steps to first reward.\n\nUnfortunately, the single experiment run (simple-task-reflection-copy2) failed to execute successfully. While the code implementation appeared comprehensive and well-structured - including experience collection, embedding-based similarity matching for experience retrieval, and bootstrap resampling for statistical analysis - the execution failure resulted in no empirical data being collected.

The hypothesis remains untested, and further experiments with successful execution would be needed to evaluate whether access to past successful experiences improves an agent's reflection quality and performance in cooking tasks. Future work should focus on resolving the execution issues and successfully implementing the experimental design to collect the necessary empirical data.",

Success rates (defined as score > 0.5) were identical at 10% for both conditions.

The experiments tested whether automatically discovered action templates from successful trajectories could improve agent performance compared to baseline random agents and agents using manually defined templates.\n\nThe results were mixed across the two experiments. In the first experiment (copy1), the discovered templates did not provide statistically significant performance improvements over baseline or manual template approaches. All three conditions achieved relatively similar performance metrics (success rates of 20-28% and mean scores of 0.056-0.072), with bootstrap resampling showing no significant differences (p>0.47).\n\nHowever, the second experiment (copy4) showed strong support for the hypothesis. The discovered template system significantly outperformed the baseline random agent (29.6% vs 6.4% average score, p<0.001) and achieved a much higher success rate (88% vs 28%). It also slightly outperformed the manual template system (29.6% vs 25.6% average score, 88% vs 76% success rate). Additionally, both template-based approaches demonstrated improved efficiency, requiring approximately 16 steps to reach a reward compared to 28 steps for the baseline.\n\nThe divergent results may be attributed to differences in implementation details, such as the specific templates discovered, the template selection criteria, or the integration method of templates into the agent's decision-making process. The second experiment identified a particularly successful three-step template for taking and cooking items that achieved a 71% success rate when attempted.\n\nOverall, while one experiment provides strong evidence that discovered templates can significantly improve agent performance, the inconsistency between experiments suggests that the effectiveness of template discovery may depend on specific implementation details. Future work should focus on identifying which aspects of template discovery and implementation are most critical for performance improvements and developing more robust methods that consistently yield benefits across different experimental conditions.",

However, there appears to be an issue with the results.json file (showing as 'null'), though the log file shows successful generations and evaluations. From the logs, both methods appeared capable of generating functional games with required mechanics, though there were some variations in completeness (particularly with win conditions). The experiment framework itself worked as designed, with proper evaluation of mechanics and logging, but the final results aggregation appears to have failed, limiting our ability to make strong statistical comparisons between the methods."

Copy4 provided the strongest evidence, with the two-stage approach achieving 100% execution success and mechanics completion compared to 93.3% execution success and only 66.7% mechanics completion for the single-stage approach. Copy5 showed that while both methods had execution success, the two-stage approach was more consistent in implementing specific mechanics like the take() method (100% vs 53.3%).\n\nOne experiment (copy1) refuted the hypothesis, finding no difference in technical validity between the approaches, with both methods achieving 100% success rates in generating valid, executable games with all required mechanics.\n\nOne experiment (copy2) was inconclusive due to data aggregation issues, though logs suggested both methods could generate functional games.\n\nA consistent finding across all experiments was that the two-stage approach required significantly more generation time (approximately 1.5-2x longer) than the single-stage approach. This represents a clear trade-off: improved technical validity at the cost of increased generation time.\n\nIn summary, the evidence predominantly supports the hypothesis that a two-stage game generation approach results in higher technical validity compared to a single-stage approach. However, this comes with a consistent time penalty that should be considered when choosing between these approaches. The experiments were well-controlled with consistent evaluation metrics, lending credibility to these findings.",

MINI_PILOT: Use 2 TWC games, 3 episodes each, max 10 steps per episode\n2. PILOT: Use 3 TWC games, 10 episodes each, max 20 steps per episode\n3. FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use 5 TWC games, 50 episodes each, max 30 steps per episode\n\nCore Components:\n1. Environment Setup:\n- Use TextWorldExpress API to initialize TWC environment\n- Set difficulty to 'easy'\n- For reproducibility, use fixed seeds: [1,2] for MINI_PILOT, [1,2,3] for PILOT, [1,2,3,4,5] for FULL_EXPERIMENT\n\n2. Baseline Agent:\n- Implement standard ReAct agent using the ReAct Agent Example codeblock\n- Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls\n- Store full trajectory in the logger\n\n3. Experimental Agent:\n- Extend ReAct agent with failure memory\n- Create FailureMemory class with methods:\n  * add_failure(observation:str, inventory:str, action:str, failure_message:str)\n  * get_similar_failures(observation:str, inventory:str) -> list\n  * summarize_failures() -> str (to keep prompt size manageable)\n- Before each action:\n  * Check if similar situations led to failures\n  * Include summarized failure history in the ReAct prompt\n  * If similar failure found, explicitly tell agent to avoid that action\n- Abstract/summarize failures by:\n  * Keep only the most recent N failures (N=5 for MINI_PILOT, N=10 for PILOT, N=20 for FULL_EXPERIMENT)\n  * Store simplified observation (remove specific object names)\n  * Use basic string similarity (difflib) with threshold 0.8\n\n4. Evaluation:\n- Primary metric: Average score per episode\n- Secondary metrics:\n  * Task success rate\n  * Average steps to completion\n  * Number of unique failure patterns identified\n  * Frequency of repeated failures\n- Use bootstrap resampling to compare baseline vs experimental:\n  * Compare distributions of scores\n  * Use p < 0.05 significance threshold\n\n5. Logging:\n- Use Logger/Debugging codeblock\n- Log for each episode:\n  * Full trajectory (observations, thoughts, actions)\n  * Score progression\n  * Failures encountered\n  * Failure memory state\n- Log summary statistics:\n  * Average score\n  * Success rate\n  * Bootstrap resampling results\n\nExecution Flow:\n1. Start with MINI_PILOT mode\n2. If successful, proceed to PILOT mode\n3. Stop after PILOT mode (human verification required for FULL_EXPERIMENT)\n4. For each mode:\n   - Run baseline agent first\n   - Run experimental agent second\n   - Perform statistical comparison\n   - Generate summary report\n\nRequired External Libraries:\n- numpy (numerical operations)\n- pandas (data analysis)\n- difflib (string similarity)\n- tqdm (progress bars)\n\nPlease implement the experiment with careful error handling and detailed logging. The code should be modular and well-documented. Run in MINI_PILOT mode first, then PILOT mode if successful.

Only one experiment (copy1) directly tested the hypothesis by comparing the container-augmented agent against a standard ReAct agent, and it found that the container-augmented agent performed significantly worse (mean score: 0.206 vs. 0.321, p=0.9975), thus refuting the hypothesis. The other three experiments compared the container-augmented agent only against a random baseline, which is insufficient to test the stated hypothesis that specifically compares against agents 'without this explicit knowledge representation' (implying otherwise capable agents like ReAct). While these three experiments showed the container agent outperforming the random baseline (with statistical significance in copies 3 and 4), they are deemed inconclusive regarding the original hypothesis. The divergent results between copy1 (where container knowledge hurt performance against ReAct) and the other implementations (where container knowledge helped against random baselines) suggest that the value of container relationship knowledge may depend on the baseline comparison and possibly implementation details. Future work should ensure consistent comparison against both random and standard ReAct baselines, investigate why container knowledge might hinder performance in some implementations, and explore whether the benefits of container knowledge emerge more clearly in more complex environments with more objects and relationships.",

Does it means the action will run in the interpreter? (in which case, it's not super interesting because, as long as the action is in the valid action list, it should run).  More interesting would be if it interpreted some signal that it worked (e.g. you can't cook a fridge or chop a pot, and the environment might say this, then (using a cheap LLM call), you might be able to interpret whether the observation returned after the action signified success or failure (e.g. 'you can't do that')).  But, extending this, it'd be interesting if it predicted more than binary success, but also did more of a state-prediction task -- e.g. predicting what the next observation will be, and then using an LLM to verify how much of it is essentially correct (perhaps proportion of sentences correct).  It'd need some number of steps of past history (say the last 1, 2, or 3 steps) to have a chance at doing this well.",

The LLM was tasked with predicting action outcomes and providing confidence scores (0-1) with rationales. The system achieved 76% accuracy in predicting action outcomes, significantly above the 50% baseline (p=0.0), with a moderate positive correlation (r=0.523, p<0.001) between confidence and accuracy. Performance varied across games (ranging from 50% to 90% accuracy). The LLM demonstrated good calibration, with higher confidence scores generally corresponding to correct predictions. The experiment included comprehensive logging, proper statistical analysis using bootstrap resampling, and visualization of results through confidence-accuracy plots. The implementation followed the requested framework faithfully, including proper environment setup, action collection, prediction system, and baseline comparisons."

Across experiments, the LLM consistently achieved prediction accuracies between 68-78%, outperforming random baselines (44-56%) but generally underperforming constant 'always predict success' baselines (82-86%), suggesting a bias toward successful actions in the environment. The correlation between confidence and accuracy varied considerably across experiments (r=0.099 to r=0.523), with three experiments showing moderate positive correlations (supporting the hypothesis), one showing minimal correlation (refuting the hypothesis), and one yielding inconclusive results. A consistent pattern across all experiments was the LLM's tendency toward high confidence scores (typically 0.85-0.89) with minimal discrimination between correct and incorrect predictions, indicating potential overconfidence. The strongest evidence for the hypothesis came from experiment copy4, which demonstrated both the highest correlation (r=0.523) and explicit mention of good calibration. Overall, while the majority of experiments (3/5) support the hypothesis that LLMs can meaningfully predict their confidence in action outcomes, the practical utility is limited by the LLM's overconfidence and the fact that a simple heuristic (always predicting success) often outperformed the LLM's predictions. These findings suggest that while LLMs show some ability to assign meaningful confidence scores that correlate with accuracy, significant improvements in calibration are needed for practical applications.",

The experiment should be structured in three pilot phases (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, and FULL_EXPERIMENT) defined by a global variable PILOT_MODE.\n\nCore Components to Implement:\n\n1. Environment Setup:\n- Use TextWorldExpress cooking tasks\n- For MINI_PILOT: Use 1-ingredient recipes only, 3 episodes, max 20 steps per episode\n- For PILOT: Use 1-2 ingredient recipes, 25 episodes, max 50 steps per episode\n- For FULL_EXPERIMENT: Use 1-3 ingredient recipes, 100 episodes, max 100 steps per episode\n- Set numLocations=3 and includeDoors=0 for all conditions to reduce complexity\n\n2. Agent Implementation:\na) Baseline Agents:\n- Direct Planning ReAct agent: Use the standard ReAct agent template without modifications\n- Random action baseline: Implement using the random action selection from TextWorldExpress example\n\nb) Experimental Agent:\n- Subgoal-based ReAct agent that uses gpt-4o-mini to decompose main goals\n- Subgoal generation prompt template:\n  \"Given the cooking task: {task_description}\nBreak this down into a sequence of specific, achievable subgoals. Format as a JSON list of strings. Example format:\n```\n[\"find the kitchen\", \"locate the cookbook\", \"read the recipe\", ...]\n```\"\n\n3. Evaluation Framework:\n- Primary metric: Task Score (partial credit) rather than binary completion\n- Secondary metrics: Number of steps taken, Time per episode\n- Log all subgoals generated, actions taken, and scores achieved\n\n4. Experiment Structure:\nMINI_PILOT:\n- 3 episodes per condition (direct, subgoal, random)\n- 1-ingredient recipes only\n- Training set seeds 1-3\n- Max 20 steps per episode\n\nPILOT:\n- 25 episodes per condition\n- Mix of 1-2 ingredient recipes\n- Training set for parameter tuning (seeds 1-15)\n- Dev set for evaluation (seeds 1-10)\n- Max 50 steps per episode\n\nFULL_EXPERIMENT (not to be run until pilot results verified):\n- 100 episodes per condition\n- 1-3 ingredient recipes\n- Training/Dev/Test split using appropriate seeds\n- Max 100 steps per episode\n\n5. Analysis Requirements:\n- Use bootstrap resampling to compare task scores between conditions\n- Generate line plots comparing:\n  a) Task scores across episodes\n  b) Average steps taken per episode\n  c) Time per episode\n- Save all raw data and analysis results to JSON files\n\n6. Logging Requirements:\n- Log all experiment parameters\n- For each episode:\n  * Task description\n  * Generated subgoals (for subgoal condition)\n  * All actions taken\n  * Task score at each step\n  * Final outcome\n  * Total time taken\n\nImplementation Notes:\n1. Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls\n2. Inject subgoals into ReAct agent prompt for the experimental condition\n3. Start with MINI_PILOT mode and only proceed to PILOT after verification\n4. Stop after PILOT completion - await human verification before FULL_EXPERIMENT\n\nOutput Requirements:\n1. Save all logs to JSON format\n2. Generate PDF plots for all visualizations\n3. Provide summary statistics for each pilot phase\n4. Include bootstrap resampling results comparing conditions",

Both experiments were conducted in PILOT mode with 10 episodes per condition, comparing a baseline ReAct agent, an enhanced ReAct agent with self-evaluation, and a random baseline. The results were mixed and largely inconclusive. In the first experiment, the enhanced agent showed better performance (mean score 0.435 vs 0.29), but this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.174). In the second experiment, the enhanced agent actually performed slightly worse than the baseline (mean score 0.473 vs 0.500) with identical success rates (20%), though again without statistical significance (p=0.617). Both experiments had small sample sizes (10 episodes per condition), which limits statistical power. The contradictory directions of effect between the two experiments suggest that the impact of adding self-evaluation to a ReAct agent may be highly variable or context-dependent. Both experiments showed that the ReAct agents (with or without self-evaluation) significantly outperformed random baselines, confirming the general effectiveness of the ReAct approach. Overall, the evidence does not support the hypothesis that adding self-evaluation consistently improves ReAct agent performance. A larger-scale experiment with more episodes would be needed to draw more definitive conclusions about the potential benefits of self-evaluation in ReAct agents.",

The mixed results suggest that template-based generation can create environments comparable to manual design in many cases, but implementation details matter significantly. The success appears dependent on the quality of templates and generation logic, with poorly designed templates potentially creating environments where agents struggle.

'find-living-thing' (easiest baseline)\n2. 'boil' (moderate complexity)\n3. 'use-thermometer' (moderate complexity)\n\nAGENTS TO IMPLEMENT:\n1. Random Baseline Agent:\n- Randomly selects from valid actions at each step\n- Use ScienceWorld API Example as template\n\n2. Affordance-Guided Agent:\n- At each step:\n  a) Get room description and visible objects\n  b) Use gpt-4o-mini to predict 3 likely useful actions with this prompt:\n     \"Given the current observation and goal, what are the 3 most likely useful actions to take? Respond in JSON format with a list of exactly 3 actions that match the valid action format.\"\n  c) Maintain success rate counter for each predicted action (success = score increased)\n  d) Action selection: 75% highest success rate action, 25% random from valid actions\n\nDATA COLLECTION:\n- Per episode:\n  * Task name and variation\n  * Steps taken\n  * Final score achieved\n  * Action history with scores\n  * For affordance agent: LLM predictions and their success rates\n\nANALYSIS:\n1. Primary Analysis:\n- Compare score progression over steps between agents\n- Use bootstrap resampling to test statistical significance\n\n2.

The single experiment conducted (simple-affordance-exploration-copy5) strongly supports the hypothesis. The experiment implemented two agents: a random baseline agent and an affordance-guided agent that used GPT-4-mini to predict useful actions. Testing was conducted across three ScienceWorld tasks of varying complexity ('find-living-thing', 'boil', and 'use-thermometer') with 10 episodes per task in PILOT mode. Results showed statistically significant improvements for the affordance-guided agent across all tasks. In the 'find-living-thing' task, the affordance agent achieved a mean score of 24.2 compared to 10.8 for the random agent (p<0.001). In the 'boil' task, the affordance agent scored 2.0 versus 0.7 for random (p=0.0015). In the 'use-thermometer' task, the affordance agent scored 11.1 versus 1.8 for random (p<0.001). The implementation included sophisticated affordance prediction with task-specific guidance, action success rate tracking, and mechanisms to prevent repetitive actions. While the sample size was relatively small (10 episodes per condition), the statistical significance of the results across all three tasks provides strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that LLM-guided exploration using affordance predictions with success/failure tracking finds successful solutions faster than random exploration in ScienceWorld tasks. Future work could benefit from larger sample sizes and testing on additional ScienceWorld tasks to further validate these findings.",

The single experiment conducted (basic-knowledge-sharing-copy4) implemented three conditions: a single agent baseline, two independent agents with private knowledge graphs, and two agents with a shared knowledge graph. The experiment ran in PILOT mode with 10 episodes per condition and 25 steps per episode.\n\nThe results clearly refute the original hypothesis. The single agent baseline achieved the highest mean score (0.062 \u00b1 0.064), while both two-agent conditions performed identically worse with mean scores of 0.011 \u00b1 0.033. Bootstrap analysis confirmed no significant advantage for the shared graph condition (p=1.0) compared to independent agents. Although the shared knowledge graph successfully captured more environment information (mean 14.1 new facts added vs 6.4 in the independent condition), this did not translate to improved task performance.\n\nThese findings suggest that simply sharing knowledge through a graph structure is insufficient to improve collaborative performance in this task environment. Several factors may explain these results: (1) the task may not have been sufficiently information-dependent to benefit from knowledge sharing, (2) the alternating-turns design may have disrupted agent continuity and planning, (3) the knowledge representation or utilization mechanisms may have been inadequate, or (4) the overhead of maintaining and consulting the knowledge graph may have outweighed its benefits. Future research should address these limitations by designing tasks with clearer information dependencies, improving knowledge representation formats, and developing more sophisticated protocols for knowledge utilization.",

The experiments were conducted in TextWorldExpress's CookingWorld environment with 10 episodes per agent in PILOT mode.\n\nThe results across the five experiments were mixed, with two supporting the hypothesis, two refuting it, and one being inconclusive. All experiments consistently showed that both ReAct variants significantly outperformed random agents, confirming the value of structured reasoning in text games.\n\nWhen comparing the ReAct+ActionTracking agent to the ReAct baseline:\n- Mean scores: Three experiments showed modest improvements with action tracking (0.485 vs 0.469, 0.425 vs 0.406, 0.54 vs 0.47), while two showed worse performance (0.420 vs 0.460, 0.369 vs 0.455).\n- Success rates: Two experiments showed improved success rates with tracking (20% vs 10% in both cases), while the other three had identical success rates between the variants (0% in two cases, not specified in one).\n- Action repetition: All experiments that reported this metric showed reduced repetition with action tracking, suggesting more efficient exploration.\n\nNone of the experiments found statistically significant differences between the two ReAct variants, likely due to the small sample size (10 episodes). The most promising results came from experiments 2 and 5, where the tracking agent achieved both higher scores and double the success rate of the baseline.\n\nThe inconsistency across experiments suggests that implementation details matter significantly. The action tracking mechanism appears to help reduce repetitive actions, but this efficiency doesn't always translate to better task completion. The hypothesis receives partial support, but the evidence indicates that simply tracking action outcomes isn't sufficient to consistently improve performance in complex sequential decision-making tasks.\n\nFuture work should focus on running the full 50-episode experiments to achieve statistical power, refining how context similarity is determined when consulting action history, and potentially combining action tracking with other enhancements to agent reasoning.",

The results showed that the LLM condition achieved the highest performance with a 90% success rate and average score of 2.4, compared to ConceptNet's 50% success rate and average score of 1.4. This supports the hypothesis that LLM-derived task-specific knowledge leads to better agent performance than general knowledge from ConceptNet. However, the experiment noted that bootstrap statistical testing did not show significant differences between conditions, likely due to the small sample size (10 episodes per condition). Despite this limitation, the substantial performance gap between LLM and ConceptNet conditions (40% higher success rate and 1.0 higher average score for LLM) provides meaningful evidence supporting the hypothesis. The experiment was generally faithful to the requested design, implementing all core components including the ReAct agent, knowledge injection methods, and proper data collection.

Use TextWorldExpress CookingWorld with simplified parameters:\n   - numLocations=3 (small environment)\n   - numIngredients=2 (simple recipes)\n   - numDistractorItems=2 (minimal distractions)\n   - includeDoors=0 (simplified navigation)\n\n2. Implement two conditions:\nBASELINE: ReAct agent with basic prompt:\n```\nYou are a cooking agent in a text-based kitchen environment. Your goal is to follow recipes and cook dishes.\n\nThink carefully about each step. You can:\n1. Look around to observe the environment\n2. Check your inventory\n3. Move between locations\n4. Interact with objects (take, drop, open, close)\n5. Cook ingredients\n\nFormat your responses as:\nThought: (your reasoning)\nAction: (your chosen action)\n```\n\nEXPERIMENTAL: ReAct agent with rules in prompt:\n```\nYou are a cooking agent in a text-based kitchen environment. Your goal is to follow recipes and cook dishes.\n\nFOLLOW THESE IMPORTANT RULES:\n1. ALWAYS read the recipe/cookbook first to know what to cook\n2. ALWAYS check what ingredients you need before starting\n3. NEVER cook ingredients before slicing them if required\n4. NEVER serve food before heating/cooking it properly\n5. ALWAYS check your inventory before taking new items\n\nThink carefully about each step. You can:\n1. Look around to observe the environment\n2. Check your inventory\n3. Move between locations\n4. Interact with objects (take, drop, open, close)\n5. Cook ingredients\n\nFormat your responses as:\nThought: (your reasoning)\nAction: (your chosen action)\n```\n\n3. For each episode:\n   - Log the full trajectory (observation, score, valid actions, chosen action)\n   - Track task completion status\n   - Record number of steps taken\n   - Calculate percentage of valid actions (actions that changed the environment state)\n\n4. Analysis:\n   - Generate line plots comparing:\n     a) Task completion rates over episodes\n     b) Percentage of valid actions over episodes\n   - Use bootstrap resampling to test for significant differences between conditions\n   - Save plots as PDFs: 'completion_rates.pdf' and 'valid_actions.pdf'\n\n5. Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls (as specified in conditioning)\n\nIMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:\n1. Start with MINI_PILOT mode for initial testing\n2. Only proceed to PILOT mode if MINI_PILOT successful\n3. Stop after PILOT mode - require human verification before FULL_EXPERIMENT\n4. Include task history in the ReAct prompt to help agent track progress\n5. Log all LLM calls and responses for debugging\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n1. Save all logs to 'log.json'\n2. Generate summary statistics for each pilot mode\n3. Create comparison plots as specified\n4. Report bootstrap resampling results\n5.

The single experiment conducted compared two ReAct-based agents: a baseline agent with a basic prompt and an experimental agent with explicit cooking rules in its prompt. The experiment was run in PILOT mode with 10 episodes (seeds 1-10).\n\nThe results clearly refute the original hypothesis. Both conditions achieved identical task completion rates of 10%, showing no improvement from the rule-guided approach. The valid action ratios were also very similar (baseline: 16.9% vs experimental: 17.5%) with no statistically significant difference (p=0.3856). \n\nThese findings suggest that simply including cooking domain rules in a ReAct agent's prompt does not meaningfully improve performance on cooking tasks in this environment. Both agents struggled with the tasks, achieving low completion rates and valid action ratios. This indicates that either: (1) the rule-guided approach as implemented is ineffective, (2) the ReAct framework may not be leveraging the rules effectively, or (3) the tasks themselves may be too challenging for the current prompt-based approach.\n\nLimitations of this meta-analysis include the small sample size (only 10 episodes) and high variance in agent performance, which limits the strength of conclusions. Additionally, only one implementation of the rule-guided approach was tested. Future work might explore different ways of incorporating rules, such as more structured rule enforcement mechanisms rather than simply including them in prompts.",

VISUALIZATION:\n- Generate line plots:\n  * Plot 1: Number of relationships over time (specific vs general for hierarchical, total for flat)\n  * Plot 2: Partial task scores over time\n  * Plot 3: Graph coverage over time\n- Save plots as PDFs\n\n6. EVALUATION:\n- Primary metric: Graph coverage of temperature relationships\n- Secondary metric: Average partial task score\n- Compare hierarchical vs flat using appropriate statistical tests\n\n7. EXECUTION ORDER:\n1. Run MINI_PILOT first\n2. If successful, run PILOT\n3. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT (await human verification)\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n- Use the Logger consistently throughout to track progress and errors\n- Save all graphs and plots with clear naming conventions including episode/step numbers\n- Generate summary statistics for each pilot phase\n- Use partial task scores (0-1) instead of binary success/failure\n- Ensure proper error handling and logging throughout\n\nThe experiment should first verify all components work in MINI_PILOT before proceeding to PILOT, and should provide clear summary statistics and visualizations at each stage.",

All five experiments consistently refuted the hypothesis, with the relationship-tracking agent performing either slightly or significantly worse than baseline agents across all studies.\n\nThe experimental design was consistent across all five experiments, implementing three agent types: (1) an experimental agent using a relationship graph, (2) a baseline agent without relationship tracking, and (3) a baseline agent assuming static friendly relationships. Each experiment used the PILOT mode with 5 scenarios and approximately 5 decisions per scenario, evaluating decision appropriateness on a 1-5 scale.\n\nKey findings:\n1. In all five experiments, the experimental agent with relationship tracking performed worse than the baseline agents, with mean scores ranging from 4.0-4.32 compared to baseline means of 4.16-5.0.\n2. Two experiments (copy3 and copy5) found statistically significant differences favoring the baseline agents, while the others showed non-significant differences in the same direction.\n3. The experimental agent appeared to sometimes overweight relationship information, making decisions that explicitly accounted for relationships but in ways that were rated as less appropriate.\n4. In scenarios with conflicting relationships, the experimental agent sometimes made decisions that attempted to minimize interaction between enemies but received lower scores for potentially unfair treatment.\n5. The baseline LLMs demonstrated strong inherent social reasoning capabilities without explicit relationship tracking.\n\nLimitations across the experiments included small sample sizes, potential evaluation bias (as the same LLM system was used for both decision-making and evaluation), and scenarios that may have been too simple to demonstrate potential advantages of relationship tracking.\n\nConclusion: The evidence consistently suggests that explicit relationship tracking using knowledge graphs does not improve\u2014and may actually hinder\u2014agent social decision making in these scenarios. This counterintuitive finding may indicate that modern LLMs already implicitly track relationships effectively, and that explicit tracking mechanisms may cause agents to overemphasize relationship dynamics at the expense of other important factors in social decision-making.",

The experiments successfully visualized these relationships in graph format, though several experiments noted limitations in the graph structure analysis. Specifically, because kitchen objects often shared the same location, co-occurrence graphs had complete connectivity (density=1.0), making it difficult to detect structural differences between baseline and metaphor-enhanced graphs. Despite this limitation in the visualization aspect, the core finding that LLMs can identify meaningful metaphorical relationships between objects based on functional similarities was strongly supported across all experiments. The consistency of results across different implementations strengthens confidence in the conclusion that LLMs can effectively detect and articulate functional metaphors between objects in a cooking domain. Future work might explore more complex environments where objects have more varied spatial distributions to better highlight structural differences in the resulting graphs.",

The experiments used GPT-4o-mini to predict object locations and properties across multiple episodes, with each experiment implementing the same basic design but with slight variations in implementation details.\n\nResults across the five experiments were mixed. Two experiments (copy1 and copy5) showed statistically significant improvements in accuracy with knowledge graph augmentation, with p-values of 0.011 and 0.025 respectively. One experiment (copy4) found identical performance between conditions, directly refuting the hypothesis. Two experiments (copy2 and copy3) found numerical advantages for knowledge graph representations but failed to reach statistical significance, likely due to high variance and small sample sizes.\n\nThe absolute accuracy levels varied considerably across experiments, ranging from very low (0.121-0.158 in copy3) to moderate (0.42-0.66 in copy1). This suggests implementation details substantially affected overall performance. All experiments used the same small sample size (5 episodes per condition), limiting statistical power.\n\nWhen knowledge graphs did help, they appeared to provide the most benefit for initial scene understanding and maintaining consistent object tracking. However, the inconsistency across experiments suggests that the advantage of knowledge graph representations may be sensitive to specific implementation details, prompt engineering, or evaluation metrics.\n\nOverall, while there is some evidence supporting the hypothesis that knowledge graphs can improve state tracking, the mixed results and implementation-dependent outcomes suggest that the benefit is not robust across all implementations. Future work should use larger sample sizes, standardize implementation details, and investigate which specific aspects of knowledge graph representations (visualization format, graph structure, etc.) contribute most to any observed improvements.",

The results show mixed performance across tasks, with no clear advantage for the knowledge graph approach. For example, in the find-living-thing task, the knowledge graph condition achieved consistent scores of 25 across all episodes, but this was matched by several episodes in the baseline conditions. The find-non-living-thing task showed more variance, with the knowledge graph condition achieving scores between 17-75, while fixed-detailed achieved one perfect score of 100.

Average scores were similar across conditions (13.4-18.6 points), and step counts were comparable (4.4-6.4 steps).

The experiment was run in PILOT mode with 10 episodes and up to 25 steps per episode. Results showed a clear pattern where simpler representations achieved higher accuracy: boolean states achieved 80.1% accuracy, numerical 72.2%, relational 72.8%, and full state only 31.3%. Statistical analysis using bootstrap resampling showed significant differences between the boolean representation and full state (p=1.0), as well as between numerical/relational and full state (p=1.0). The numerical and relational representations performed similarly (p=0.38). This suggests that simpler state representations lead to more accurate LLM simulations, with boolean states performing best. However, limitations include the relatively small sample size (10 episodes) and the use of only one LLM model (gpt-4o-mini)."

The experiments used gpt-4o-mini to predict state transitions across four complexity levels: boolean, numerical, relational, and full dynamics. Results were highly inconsistent across experiments. Two experiments (copy1 and copy4) strongly supported the hypothesis that performance degrades with increasing complexity, showing clear downward trends in accuracy as complexity increased, with the sharpest drops at the full complexity level. Two experiments (copy3 and copy5) refuted the hypothesis, with copy5 showing the complete opposite pattern - accuracy significantly improved with increasing complexity, reaching highest performance (93.9%) with full state representation. One experiment (copy2) was deemed inconclusive due to implementation issues and unrealistically perfect performance across conditions. The contradictory findings suggest that implementation details may significantly impact results, including how state representations are constructed, how the LLM is prompted, and how accuracy is measured. Notably, the magnitude of effects varied dramatically across experiments - from modest differences in some cases to dramatic drops (e.g., 31.3% accuracy for full complexity in copy1) in others. These inconsistencies highlight the sensitivity of LLM performance to experimental design choices and the need for standardized evaluation protocols. Future work should investigate which specific aspects of state complexity (boolean properties, numerical values, object relationships, or dynamics) most impact LLM performance, and whether these effects are consistent across different LLM architectures and sizes beyond gpt-4o-mini.",

METRICS AND LOGGING:\n- Primary DiscoveryWorld metrics:\n  * Task completion (binary)\n  * Procedure score (normalized 0-1)\n  * Knowledge score (if available)\n- Custom metrics:\n  * Number of hypotheses generated\n  * Number of experiments conducted\n  * Hypothesis confirmation rate\n  * Average steps per experiment\n- Log detailed information for each episode:\n  * All observations and actions\n  * Hypothesis list updates\n  * Experiment designs and results\n  * DiscoveryWorld metrics at each step\n\n5. ANALYSIS:\n- Compare metrics between experimental and baseline conditions using bootstrap resampling\n- Generate summary statistics for all metrics\n- Create a detailed report including:\n  * Performance comparisons\n  * Example hypotheses generated\n  * Example experiments designed\n  * Statistical significance of differences\n\n6. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:\n- Use the Plant Nutrients theme with binary nutrients (present/absent)\n- Configure for 2 test fields to reduce complexity\n- Set difficulty to 'Easy' as recommended\n- Save all experiment results and logs with clear naming conventions\n- Include seed and configuration information in all saved files\n\n7. EXECUTION ORDER:\n1. First run MINI_PILOT\n2. If successful, run PILOT\n3. Stop after PILOT - do not run FULL_EXPERIMENT (this requires manual verification)\n\nThe experiment should be highly reproducible, with all random seeds explicitly set and documented. All LLM prompts should be clearly logged for analysis. The hypothesis-driven agent should maintain its hypothesis list as a JSON file that's updated and saved after each experiment, allowing for detailed analysis of its scientific reasoning process.",

EXPERIMENT STRUCTURE:\nCreate a global variable PILOT_MODE that can be set to 'MINI_PILOT', 'PILOT', or 'FULL_EXPERIMENT'. The experiment should run according to these settings:\n- MINI_PILOT: Run 2 episodes of Proteomics-Easy (seeds 0-1), max 20 steps per episode\n- PILOT: Run 10 episodes of Proteomics-Easy (seeds 0-9), max 50 steps per episode\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Run 50 episodes each of Proteomics-Easy/Normal/Challenge (seeds 0-49), max 100 steps per episode\n\n2. KNOWLEDGE GRAPH AGENT IMPLEMENTATION:\n- Extend the ReAct agent template to create a KnowledgeGraphAgent class\n- The agent should maintain a knowledge graph in DOT format with three types of nodes:\n  * Object nodes (e.g., 'animal_1', 'animal_2')\n  * Property nodes (e.g., 'protein_level_high', 'protein_level_low')\n  * Hypothesis nodes (e.g., 'animal_1_is_outlier')\n- Edges should represent:\n  * Object-Property relationships (e.g., 'animal_1 -> protein_level_high')\n  * Object-Object relationships (e.g., 'animal_1 -> similar_to -> animal_2')\n  * Evidence for hypotheses (e.g., 'protein_level_high -> supports -> animal_1_is_outlier')\n\n3. AGENT OPERATION:\n- Initialize with empty graph\n- After each observation:\n  * Extract objects and properties\n  * Add/update nodes and edges\n  * Save graph as both .dot and .pdf files (numbered by step)\n- During 'think' step:\n  * Use gpt-4o-mini to analyze current graph\n  * Generate hypotheses based on patterns\n  * Decide next action based on graph state\n- During 'act' step:\n  * Execute chosen action\n  * Update graph with results\n\n4. BASELINE IMPLEMENTATION:\n- Implement standard ReAct agent as baseline\n- Use identical environment parameters and LLM (gpt-4o-mini)\n- Run same number of episodes/steps as experimental condition\n\n5. METRICS AND EVALUATION:\n- Primary metrics to collect per episode:\n  * Task completion (0/1)\n  * Task process score (normalized 0-1)\n  * Graph statistics (nodes/edges over time)\n- Save all metrics to JSON files\n- Generate plots:\n  * Task completion/process scores over episodes\n  * Graph complexity over time\n- Run bootstrap analysis to compare baseline vs experimental\n\n6. LOGGING:\n- Log all observations, actions, and graph changes\n- Log LLM prompts and responses\n- Log metrics after each episode\n- Save graphs as both .dot and .pdf at each step\n\n7. OUTPUT:\n- Generate summary statistics for each condition\n- Create comparison plots between conditions\n- Save all raw data and graphs\n- Report statistical significance of differences\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n1. Start with MINI_PILOT mode for initial testing\n2. Only proceed to PILOT if MINI_PILOT successful\n3. Stop after PILOT - await human verification before FULL_EXPERIMENT\n4. Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls\n5. Focus on Task Completion and Process scores initially\n\nERROR HANDLING:\n- Implement robust error handling throughout\n- Log all errors clearly\n- Save partial results if experiment terminates early",

The original hypothesis posited that agents maintaining explicit knowledge graphs would outperform baseline agents by better remembering past experiments and making more informed decisions.\n\nThe single experiment conducted (knowledge-graph-discovery-copy4) provides support for this hypothesis, though with some limitations. The knowledge graph agent demonstrated significantly better process scores (mean=0.25) compared to the baseline ReAct agent (mean=0.083), with statistical significance (p=0.0079). The knowledge graph agent also engaged in more meaningful scientific behaviors, successfully measuring protein levels in 4 out of 10 episodes, while the baseline agent rarely made measurements.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that neither agent achieved task completion in any episode, suggesting that while the knowledge graph approach improved the discovery process, further refinements may be needed to achieve full task success. The experiment was conducted in PILOT mode with 10 episodes on the Proteomics-Easy difficulty level, which provides a limited but informative test of the hypothesis.\n\nThe implementation included most key components from the specification, though there were some deviations - notably incomplete graph visualization and bootstrap analysis. Despite these limitations, the results provide preliminary evidence that structured knowledge representation through graphs can enhance scientific discovery processes in AI agents.\n\nTo strengthen these findings, future work should include: (1) testing on more difficult tasks beyond Proteomics-Easy, (2) running more episodes for greater statistical power, (3) implementing the full experimental design including visualization components, and (4) exploring variations in knowledge graph structure and utilization strategies to further improve task completion rates.",

The knowledge graph agent tracked object locations, relationships, and recipe progress. Results showed that the baseline agent achieved a mean score of 0.334 (success rate 16%) while the knowledge graph agent achieved a mean score of 0.235 (success rate 4%). Bootstrap resampling analysis showed no significant improvement from the knowledge graph (p=0.977). The knowledge graph agent took fewer steps on average (8.56 vs 22.4) but was less successful, suggesting it may have been too constrained or conservative in its actions. The implementation successfully created the knowledge graph infrastructure but may have needed better integration with the agent's decision-making process. Key limitations include the small sample size, potential implementation issues with how the knowledge graph informed actions, and the possibility that the knowledge graph representation wasn't optimal for this task domain."

The single experiment conducted compared a baseline ReAct agent against a knowledge graph-enhanced version across 25 episodes in TextWorldExpress cooking tasks. The results clearly refute the hypothesis: the knowledge graph agent performed significantly worse than the baseline, achieving a mean score of 0.235 (4% success rate) compared to the baseline's 0.334 (16% success rate). Statistical analysis using bootstrap resampling confirmed no improvement from the knowledge graph (p=0.977). Interestingly, the knowledge graph agent took fewer steps on average (8.56 vs 22.4), suggesting it may have been more efficient in some ways but ultimately less effective at completing tasks. This could indicate that the knowledge graph implementation constrained the agent's exploration or decision-making process. Several factors may explain these results: (1) the knowledge graph representation may not have been optimal for this particular domain, (2) the integration between the graph and the agent's reasoning process may have been flawed, or (3) the additional complexity of maintaining and reasoning over the graph may have detracted from the agent's performance rather than enhancing it. Future work should explore different knowledge graph structures, improved integration methods, and potentially larger sample sizes to verify these findings. The experiment demonstrates that simply adding a knowledge graph to a ReAct agent does not automatically improve performance and may actually hinder it if not implemented optimally.",

The experiment ran in PILOT mode with 20 target values and 3 runs per value. Results showed that the simple baseline significantly outperformed both the LLM and mathematical approaches, achieving 100% success rate at all tolerance levels (1%, 5%, 10%) with a mean error of only 0.044%. The LLM approach performed moderately well with success rates of 32.7% (1% tolerance), 79.6% (5%), and 89.8% (10%), while the mathematical approach performed poorly with 0% (1%), 23.7% (5%), and 35.6% (10%) success rates. The simple baseline was also computationally efficient, with mean computation time of 7.32 seconds compared to 5.92 seconds for LLM and 1.84 seconds for the mathematical approach. The experiment successfully implemented all required components including pilot modes, standard resistor series, evaluation metrics, and data collection, though some LLM calls failed during execution."

The results show inconsistent performance across experiments. Two experiments support the hypothesis, with success rates of 79.6% and 50% at 5% tolerance. One experiment clearly refutes the hypothesis, with the LLM approach achieving less than 32.2% success even at a more lenient 10% tolerance. Two experiments were inconclusive as they reported success rates at 1% tolerance (21.7% and 18.3%) but didn't explicitly state the 5% tolerance success rate. Across all experiments, the LLM approach was consistently outperformed by both the simple baseline and mathematical optimization approaches. The simple baseline was surprisingly effective, achieving 90-100% success rates within 1% tolerance in most experiments, while being computationally efficient. The mathematical optimization approach generally achieved the highest accuracy but at the cost of longer computation times. The LLM approach showed high variability in performance, sometimes suggesting inappropriate combinations (like using parallel when series would be better), leading to large errors exceeding 90% in some cases. Overall, while GPT-4 can sometimes suggest viable resistor substitutions within 5% tolerance, its performance is inconsistent and significantly inferior to simpler algorithmic approaches, suggesting that this task may not be well-suited for LLM-based solutions.",
