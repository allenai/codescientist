## CodeScientist Generated Experiments Directory

This directory is normally where the experiments that CodeScientist generates are stored (including code, logs, the final generated report, etc).

This directory can grow to be quite large.

The following archive contains the successfully completed experiments (regardless of whether they supported, rejected, or were inconclusive towards the hypothesis) for the main experiment in the CodeScientist paper: 50 ideas, run 5 times each, with expert notes, using Claude Sonnet 3.5 (10-22 version).  The directory is approximately 7GB unzipped.  

If you place the contents of this archive in the `generated-experiments/` folder, then the links for these experiments in the `Experiment Monitor` (i.e. the details, ZIP file, and report PDF buttons) should function normally:
