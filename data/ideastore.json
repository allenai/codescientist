If no progress is made for N steps, decrease thresholds by 10%. If progress is made, gradually increase thresholds back toward initial values. Use the LLM proxy server to score object/receptacle relevance as in the original Eliminate module, but apply the adaptive thresholds. Test on 5 AlfWorld tasks with 10 episodes each.
