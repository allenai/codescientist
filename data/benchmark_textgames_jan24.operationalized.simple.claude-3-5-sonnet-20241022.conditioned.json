The experiment should have three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, FULL_EXPERIMENT) defined as a global variable PILOT_MODE.\n\nPilot Modes:\n- MINI_PILOT: Test 3 objects (water, ice, steam) for 2 episodes each, 10 steps per episode\n- PILOT: Test 10 objects for 5 episodes each, 25 steps per episode\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Test 50 objects for 50 episodes each, 100 steps per episode\n\nThe experiment should:\n\n1. Initialize environment and knowledge bases:\n- Use ScienceWorld API with default parameters\n- Load ConceptNet knowledge base\n- Initialize logger for detailed logging\n- Set random seed for reproducibility\n\n2. Define test objects and properties:\n- For MINI_PILOT: Use ['water', 'ice', 'steam']\n- For PILOT: Add ['metal', 'wood', 'glass', 'oil', 'sand', 'rock', 'plastic']\n- Properties to check: temperature (cold/cool/room-temp/warm/hot) and state (solid/liquid/gas)\n\n3. Extract ConceptNet predictions:\n- Create a property extractor that queries ConceptNet for:\n  * Temperature using relations: ['HasProperty', 'AtLocation']\n  * State using relations: ['IsA', 'HasProperty']\n- Map ConceptNet terms to standardized categories (e.g., 'IsA liquid' -> state:liquid)\n\n4. Create verification agent:\n- Implement simple agent that:\n  * Locates target object\n  * Uses 'examine' and 'feel' actions\n  * Records temperature/state observations\n- Store results as {object, property_type, conceptnet_prediction, observed_value}\n\n5. Run experiments:\n- For each object:\n  * Get ConceptNet predictions\n  * Run N episodes (N depends on PILOT_MODE)\n  * Record predictions vs observations\n- Log all steps, actions, and observations\n\n6. Analysis:\n- Generate confusion matrices for temperature and state predictions\n- Calculate accuracy metrics (precision, recall, F1)\n- Use bootstrap resampling to test if ConceptNet predictions are significantly better than random\n- Create visualization comparing predicted vs observed properties\n\n7. Output:\n- Save all results to JSON files\n- Generate plots:\n  * Confusion matrices\n  * Accuracy by property type\n  * Prediction vs observation agreement rates\n\nSpecific Requirements:\n1. Use gpt-4o-mini for any LLM calls\n2. Run MINI_PILOT first, then if successful, run PILOT\n3. Stop after PILOT - do not run FULL_EXPERIMENT\n4. Log all steps extensively using the Logger\n5. Include clear error handling and status messages\n\nExpected Runtime:\n- MINI_PILOT: ~5 minutes\n- PILOT: ~30 minutes\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: ~8 hours (not to be run automatically)\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n- All code runs without errors\n- Results are properly logged and analyzed\n- Statistical comparisons completed\n- Visualizations generated\n- Clear indication of ConceptNet prediction accuracy",

While the specification says to just provide a binary prediction (yes/no) as to whether the action will succeed (as well as the confidence score), it's not super clear what 'action will succeed' means.  Does it means the action will run in the interpreter? (in which case, it's not super interesting because, as long as the action is in the valid action list, it should run).  More interesting would be if it interpreted some signal that it worked (e.g. you can't cook a fridge or chop a pot, and the environment might say this, then (using a cheap LLM call), you might be able to interpret whether the observation returned after the action signified success or failure (e.g. 'you can't do that')).  But, extending this, it'd be interesting if it predicted more than binary success, but also did more of a state-prediction task -- e.g. predicting what the next observation will be, and then using an LLM to verify how much of it is essentially correct (perhaps proportion of sentences correct).  It'd need some number of steps of past history (say the last 1, 2, or 3 steps) to have a chance at doing this well.",

EXPERIMENT MODES\nImplement a global PILOT_MODE variable with three settings:\n- MINI_PILOT: 3 episodes, max 20 steps each, using training set seeds 1-3\n- PILOT: 25 episodes, max 50 steps each, using training set seeds 1-25\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: 100 episodes, max 100 steps each, using appropriate train/dev/test splits\n\nThe code should run MINI_PILOT first, then if successful, run PILOT. It should stop after PILOT (requiring manual verification before FULL_EXPERIMENT).\n\n2. ENVIRONMENT SETUP\nUse TextWorldExpress CookingWorld with simplified parameters:\n- numLocations: 3 (to minimize navigation complexity)\n- numIngredients: 2 (for MINI_PILOT/PILOT)\n- numDistractorItems: 2 (for MINI_PILOT/PILOT)\n- includeDoors: 0 (to minimize navigation complexity)\n- limitInventorySize: 0 (to minimize inventory management complexity)\n\n3. MODELS TO IMPLEMENT AND TEST\na) Two-Level Planner (Experimental):\n- High-level planner using gpt-4o-mini to decompose recipe tasks into steps\n- Low-level ReAct agent using gpt-4o-mini to execute specific actions\n- High-level prompt should extract recipe requirements and break into subtasks\n- Low-level ReAct agent should focus on completing one subtask at a time\n\nb) Baselines:\n- Random action baseline (using existing TextWorldExpress example)\n- Single-level ReAct baseline (using existing ReAct example with gpt-4o-mini)\n\n4. DATA COLLECTION\nFor each episode, collect:\n- Score at each step (not just final score)\n- Number of steps taken\n- Planning time (both high and low level for experimental, just planning time for baseline)\n- Number of invalid actions attempted\n- Full trajectory of observations and actions\n- For experimental condition, also log high-level plan and subtask decomposition\n\n5. VISUALIZATION\nGenerate for each episode:\n- DOT graph showing high-level plan decomposition (experimental only)\n- Line plot showing score progression over steps\n\nGenerate for each condition:\n- Box plots comparing scores across conditions\n- Line plots showing average score progression\n\n6. ANALYSIS\nPerform bootstrap resampling analysis to compare:\n- Final scores between conditions\n- Number of steps taken between conditions\n- Planning time between conditions\n\n7. OUTPUT\nGenerate a results.json file containing:\n- All collected metrics\n- Statistical analysis results\n- Paths to generated visualizations\n\nThe code should use extensive logging to track progress and any errors. All visualizations should be saved as PDF files. The experiment should be structured to allow easy modification of parameters for the FULL_EXPERIMENT phase.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n1. Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls to minimize cost/time\n2. Focus on score rather than task completion rate\n3. Ensure all file paths are relative to the execution directory\n4. Include error handling and graceful failure modes\n5. Log all LLM prompts and responses for debugging",

Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT.\n\n2. TEST SCENARIOS\nImplement these 5 simple scenarios (use fewer for MINI_PILOT):\na) \"Birthday Party\": 3 characters (Alice, Bob, Charlie). Alice and Bob are friends, both neutral to Charlie. Decision task: Who to invite to a party?\nb) \"Resource Competition\": 3 characters (David, Emma, Frank). David and Emma are enemies, Frank neutral to both. Decision task: How to distribute limited resources?\nc) \"Group Project\": 3 characters (Grace, Henry, Isabel). Grace and Isabel are friends, Henry enemy to Grace. Decision task: How to assign project roles?\nd) \"Lunch Plans\": 2 characters (John, Karen). Initially neutral. Decision task: Where to have lunch given preferences?\ne) \"Moving Help\": 3 characters (Lisa, Mike, Nina). Lisa friend with both others, Mike and Nina enemies. Decision task: Who should help with moving?\n\n3. AGENT CONDITIONS\nImplement three agent conditions:\na) Experimental Agent (with graph):\n   - Maintains DOT/Graphviz graph of relationships (friend/neutral/enemy)\n   - Updates relationships based on interaction outcomes\n   - Uses relationships to inform decisions\nb) Baseline Agent (no graph):\n   - Makes decisions without relationship tracking\n   - Uses only current scenario information\nc) Static Baseline Agent:\n   - Always assumes friendly relationships\n   - Makes decisions based on this assumption\n\n4. EVALUATION METRICS\nFor each episode:\na) Primary metric: Decision appropriateness (rated by gpt-4o-mini)\n   - Score 0-10 for each decision\n   - Provide context and relationship state to evaluator\nb) Secondary metric: Graph consistency\n   - Track changes in relationship states\n   - Log all graph states (save as DOT files, convert to PDF)\n\n5. IMPLEMENTATION STEPS\na) Initialize scenario:\n   - Create character nodes in graph\n   - Set initial relationships\n   - Save initial graph state\nb) For each step:\n   - Log current state\n   - Agent makes decision\n   - Update relationships\n   - Save updated graph\n   - Log decision and rationale\nc) After each episode:\n   - Save final graph state\n   - Get gpt-4o-mini evaluation of decisions\n   - Calculate consistency metrics\n\n6. DATA COLLECTION\nFor each condition:\n- Log all decisions and rationales\n- Save all graph states as DOT files\n- Convert DOT files to PDF for visualization\n- Store evaluator scores\n- Track relationship changes\n\n7. ANALYSIS\nCompare conditions using bootstrap resampling:\n- Primary: Decision appropriateness scores\n- Secondary: Graph consistency metrics\n- Generate summary statistics\n- Create comparison visualizations\n\n8. OUTPUT\nGenerate a report containing:\n- Summary statistics for each condition\n- Bootstrap resampling results\n- Graph visualizations (as PDFs)\n- Decision logs\n- Evaluator scores\n\nNOTE: Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls (agent decisions and evaluation) to maintain consistency and reduce costs.\n\nThe experiment should first run in MINI_PILOT mode.

There have been a lot of similar ideas generated, the one that makes this one more viable is that it's not just tracking successful actions in isolation, but considering the *context* in which they occurred.  Text games generally require long action sequences, where each action is taken at the appropriate time, when all the right conditions are met.  Taking the context into account should help it figure out when it's appropriate to take a particular action.

Not clear what it means by 'pick and place' tasks -- possibly the TextWorld Common Sense environment in TextWorldExpress, which is very pick-and-place.  Coin Collector is slightly pick-and-place (more explore-and-find).  Other notes: (a) It should probably evaluate with Task Score (in addition to Task Completion), since text game environments are challenging, and many agents only get partial scores (and rarely complete a given environment).  Other note: No baselines are mentioned.  The baseline should probably be a vanilla ReAct agent that's not augmented in this way.  Could also include a random agent, just for an extra baseline.  Of course all agents should be evaluated on exactly the same seeds.",

The experiment should be structured with three pilot modes (controlled by a global PILOT_MODE variable):\n\nPILOT MODES:\n- MINI_PILOT: 2 episodes, max 20 steps each, training set only\n- PILOT: 10 episodes, max 50 steps each, using training set (8 episodes) and dev set (2 episodes)\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: 50 episodes, max 100 steps each, proper train/dev/test split\n\nENVIRONMENT SETUP:\n1. Use TextWorldExpress TWC environment\n2. For MINI_PILOT and PILOT, use these parameters: numLocations=2, numItemsToPutAway=2, includeDoors=0\n3. For FULL_EXPERIMENT, use default parameters\n\nAGENTS TO IMPLEMENT:\n1. Experimental Agent (Hierarchical + LLM Filtering):\n- Two-level hierarchical agent based on ReAct architecture\n- High-level policy generates subgoals (e.g., 'go to kitchen', 'pick up apple')\n- Each subgoal is evaluated by gpt-4o-mini using this prompt template:\n  \"Rate this subgoal's quality (1-5):\\nTask: {task_description}\\nCurrent Observation: {observation}\\nProposed Subgoal: {subgoal}\\n\\nRate on:\\n1. Feasibility (can it be done now?)\\n2. Relevance (helps complete task?)\\n3. Clarity (unambiguous?)\\n\\nProvide rating as JSON: {\\\"rating\\\": X, \\\"explanation\\\": \\\"...\\\"}\\n\"\n- Only pursue subgoals rated 4 or higher\n- Low-level policy uses primitive actions to accomplish approved subgoals\n\n2. Baseline Agents:\n- Hierarchical without filtering (same as experimental but pursues all subgoals)\n- Flat ReAct agent (standard implementation, no hierarchy)\n- Random action baseline\n\nMETRICS TO COLLECT:\n1. Task completion rate\n2. Average steps to completion\n3. Task score\n4. Subgoal quality scores (for hierarchical agents)\n5. Number of subgoals generated/filtered\n\nLOGGING:\n- Log all observations, actions, scores at each step\n- For hierarchical agents, log all subgoals and their quality scores\n- Save separate logs for each agent type\n\nANALYSIS:\n1. Use bootstrap resampling to compare:\n   - Completion rates between agents\n   - Steps to completion between agents\n   - Task scores between agents\n2. For hierarchical agents, analyze:\n   - Distribution of subgoal quality scores\n   - Correlation between subgoal quality and task success\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n1. Use gpt-4o-mini for ALL LLM calls (both subgoal generation and evaluation)\n2. Run MINI_PILOT first, then PILOT if successful\n3. Stop after PILOT - do not run FULL_EXPERIMENT\n4. Use same random seeds across all agents for fair comparison\n5. Implement proper error handling and logging\n\nOUTPUT:\n1. Generate a results.json with all metrics and statistical comparisons\n2. Generate a detailed log.json with full trajectories\n3. Create a brief report.txt summarizing key findings\n\nPlease implement this experiment with careful attention to error handling, logging, and reproducibility. Start with MINI_PILOT mode to verify basic functionality before proceeding to PILOT mode.",

ENVIRONMENT SETUP\n- Use TextWorldExpress cooking tasks with simplified parameters:\n  * numLocations=3 (small environment)\n  * includeDoors=0 (no doors)\n  * limitInventorySize=0 (unlimited inventory)\n  * numDistractorItems=2 (minimal distractors)\n- Vary numIngredients based on PILOT_MODE (1 for MINI_PILOT, 1-2 for PILOT, 1-3 for FULL_EXPERIMENT)\n\n3. AGENT IMPLEMENTATIONS\nImplement three agent types:\na) Subgoal-Based ReAct Agent:\n- Use gpt-4o-mini to decompose the main task into subgoals\n- Prompt the LLM with the task description and ask it to break it down into ordered subgoals\n- Example prompt: \"Break down the cooking task '{task_description}' into a sequence of specific subgoals. Format as a JSON list of strings.\"\n- Inject each subgoal into the ReAct agent's prompt one at a time\n\nb) Direct ReAct Agent (Baseline 1):\n- Use the same base ReAct agent but without subgoal decomposition\n- Give it the full task description directly\n\nc) Random Agent (Baseline 2):\n- Randomly select from valid actions at each step\n\n4. DATA COLLECTION\nFor each episode, record:\n- Task description and complexity (num ingredients)\n- For subgoal agent: list of generated subgoals\n- Full action trajectory\n- Step-by-step scores\n- Final score\n- Completion status\n- Total steps taken\n- Time taken\n\n5. ANALYSIS\nFor each pilot mode:\na) Calculate per-condition metrics:\n- Average score\n- Score progression over steps (for plotting)\n- Average number of steps taken\n- Task completion rate (based on score thresholds)\n\nb) Statistical Analysis:\n- Use bootstrap resampling to compare:\n  * Subgoal vs Direct planning\n  * Both vs Random baseline\n- Analyze per recipe complexity (1, 2, or 3 ingredients)\n\nc) Generate plots:\n- Score progression over steps for each condition\n- Performance comparison across recipe complexities\n\n6. EXECUTION ORDER\n1. Start with MINI_PILOT mode\n2. If successful, proceed to PILOT mode\n3. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT (requires manual verification)\n\n7. OUTPUT\nGenerate a results.json file containing:\n- All configuration parameters\n- Raw episode data\n- Summary statistics\n- Bootstrap analysis results\n\nGenerate plots saved as PDFs:\n- score_progression.pdf\n- complexity_comparison.pdf\n\nAll experiment progress, errors, and results should be logged using the Logger.\n\nNOTE: Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls as specified in the special conditioning instructions.",

Two-Level Hierarchical Agent:\n   - High-level planner using gpt-4o-mini that generates measurement plans\n   - Low-level executor that converts plans to actions\n   - Planner should receive task description and generate ordered list of measurements\n   - Executor should implement each measurement using available actions\n   - Communication protocol between levels using JSON format\n\n2. Baseline Agents:\n   - Standard ReAct agent (using same LLM)\n   - Flat version of hierarchical agent (single-level planning/execution)\n\n3. Environment Setup:\n   - Use DiscoveryWorld API\n   - Tasks: 'Reactor Lab' and 'Proteomics' scenarios (Easy difficulty)\n   - Focus on measurement-specific tasks\n\n4. Evaluation Framework:\n   - Log all agent actions, plans, and outcomes\n   - Track task scores, steps taken, and measurement accuracy\n   - Use bootstrap resampling for statistical comparison\n\nPilot Modes Configuration:\n\nMINI_PILOT:\n- Tasks: Only 'Reactor Lab' (Easy)\n- Episodes: 2 episodes\n- Max steps per episode: 20\n- Purpose: Quick code verification\n\nPILOT:\n- Tasks: Both 'Reactor Lab' and 'Proteomics' (Easy)\n- Episodes: 10 episodes per task\n- Max steps per episode: 50\n- Purpose: Initial results validation\n\nFULL_EXPERIMENT:\n- Tasks: Both scenarios plus one additional\n- Episodes: 30 episodes per task\n- Max steps per episode: 100\n- Purpose: Complete evaluation\n\nRequired Metrics:\n1. Task Score (normalized score from DiscoveryWorld)\n2. Steps taken per episode\n3. Plan quality evaluation\n4. Statistical significance between conditions\n\nOutput Requirements:\n1. JSON log file with all experimental data\n2. Summary statistics for each condition\n3. Bootstrap comparison results\n4. Example episodes showing agent behavior\n\nExecution Order:\n1. Run MINI_PILOT first\n2. If successful, run PILOT\n3. Stop after PILOT for human verification\n4.

The experiment should include the following components:\n\n1. PILOT MODE SETTINGS:\nCreate a global variable PILOT_MODE that can be set to one of:\n- MINI_PILOT: 2 episodes, 20 steps each, training set only\n- PILOT: 10 episodes, 50 steps each, training set only\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: 100 episodes, 100 steps each (split between train/dev/test)\nThe experiment should initially run in MINI_PILOT mode, then PILOT mode if successful. Do not run FULL_EXPERIMENT mode (this requires manual verification first).\n\n2. ENVIRONMENT SETUP:\n- Use ScienceWorld's heating task\n- Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls\n- Set random seed to 42 for reproducibility\n\n3. BELIEF GRAPH IMPLEMENTATION:\nCreate two agent versions:\na) Hierarchical Agent:\n- Bottom level: Specific relationships (e.g., 'stove heats water')\n- Top level: General rules (e.g., 'heat sources increase temperature')\n- Store in DOT format with blue nodes for specific relationships, red for general rules\n- Implement simple rule abstraction: When 2+ similar specific relationships exist (e.g., 'stove heats water', 'stove heats milk'), create general rule ('stove heats liquids')\n\nb) Baseline Agent (Flat):\n- Single-level graph storing all relationships\n- Store in DOT format with all nodes in blue\n\n4. EXPERIMENT PROCEDURE:\nFor each pilot mode:\n1. Run both agents (hierarchical and flat) on the heating task\n2. At each step:\n   - Log observation, action, reward, score\n   - Save current state of belief graph (DOT format)\n   - Log any new relationships discovered\n   - Track task progress score (0-1 scale)\n3. After each episode:\n   - Generate graph visualizations\n   - Calculate metrics:\n     * Number of specific relationships\n     * Number of general rules (hierarchical only)\n     * Graph coverage score (compared to predefined list)\n     * Task progress score\n\n5. ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION:\n1. Generate line plots:\n   - X-axis: Steps (0 to max_steps)\n   - Y-axis plots:\n     a) Number of relationships (specific vs general)\n     b) Task progress score\n     c) Graph coverage score\n2. Save plots as PDFs with clear labels and legends\n3. Log summary statistics for each episode\n\n6. PREDEFINED TEMPERATURE RELATIONSHIPS:\nCreate a list of expected relationships to measure coverage against:\n- heat_sources = ['stove', 'fire', 'sunlight']\n- cool_sources = ['ice', 'freezer', 'snow']\n- affected_items = ['water', 'juice', 'milk', 'soup']\nGenerate all valid combinations for coverage calculation.\n\n7. LOGGING:\nUse the Logger class to track:\n- Experiment configuration\n- Episode progress\n- Graph changes\n- Performance metrics\n- Error messages\n- Timing information\n\n8. OUTPUT:\nGenerate a results.json file containing:\n- Configuration settings\n- Episode-level metrics\n- Final performance comparisons\n- Statistical analysis of differences between conditions\n\nPlease implement this experiment with careful error handling and detailed logging. The code should be modular and well-documented. Run first in MINI_PILOT mode, then if successful, in PILOT mode, stopping before FULL_EXPERIMENT mode.",

Knowledge Graph Agent:\n   - Extend the ReAct agent template to include knowledge graph maintenance\n   - Store graph in DOT format with three node types: objects, properties, hypotheses\n   - Edge types should include: has_property, related_to, supports, contradicts\n   - After each observation/action, update graph and save as both .dot and .pdf\n   - Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls\n\n2. Experiment Configuration:\nMINI_PILOT:\n   - Task: Proteomics-Easy only\n   - Seeds: 0-1 only\n   - Max steps per episode: 20\n   - Save graphs every 5 steps\n\nPILOT:\n   - Tasks: Proteomics-Easy, Chemistry-Easy\n   - Seeds: 0-4\n   - Max steps per episode: 50\n   - Save graphs every 10 steps\n\nFULL_EXPERIMENT:\n   - All DiscoveryWorld tasks\n   - Seeds: 0-9\n   - Max steps per episode: Task-dependent (use DiscoveryWorld defaults)\n   - Save graphs every 20 steps\n\n3. Metrics to Track:\n   - Primary: Task completion rate, Task process score, Explanatory knowledge score\n   - Secondary: Number of nodes/edges over time, Graph update frequency\n   - Log all metrics after each episode\n\n4. Analysis Requirements:\n   - Generate line plots comparing metrics between conditions\n   - Use bootstrap resampling to test for significant differences\n   - Save all raw data as JSON for future analysis\n\n5. Implementation Steps:\na) First implement the knowledge graph maintenance:\n   - Initialize empty graph\n   - Add nodes for observed objects/properties\n   - Add edges for relationships\n   - Add hypothesis nodes when agent makes predictions\n   - Update graph based on experimental results\n\nb) Then implement the agent's decision making:\n   - Modify ReAct agent's think step to consider graph state\n   - Add graph visualization to logging\n   - Track graph-based metrics\n\nc) Finally implement evaluation:\n   - Run both agents (baseline ReAct and knowledge graph)\n   - Compare performance using bootstrap resampling\n   - Generate plots of metrics over time\n\n6. Required Directory Structure:\n   /graphs/         - Store .dot and .pdf files\n   /metrics/        - Store performance metrics\n   /analysis/       - Store statistical analyses\n   /logs/           - Store detailed logs\n\n7. Logging Requirements:\n   - Log all observations, actions, graph updates\n   - Log metrics after each episode\n   - Log statistical analyses\n   - Save graphs as both .dot and .pdf\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n1. Start with MINI_PILOT mode to verify basic functionality\n2. Only proceed to PILOT after MINI_PILOT shows correct behavior\n3. Stop after PILOT - do not run FULL_EXPERIMENT (this requires manual verification)\n4. Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls to minimize costs\n5.

PILOT FRAMEWORK\nImplement three execution modes controlled by a global variable PILOT_MODE:\n- MINI_PILOT: 2 episodes per condition, max 10 steps per episode\n- PILOT: 10 episodes per condition, max 20 steps per episode\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: 20 episodes per condition, max 30 steps per episode\nInitially run MINI_PILOT, then if successful, run PILOT. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT.\n\n2. ENVIRONMENT SETUP\n- Use ScienceWorld's boiling water task\n- Initialize with random seeds 1-20 for reproducibility\n- Log all environment interactions using the Logger\n\n3. KNOWLEDGE SOURCES\nImplement four conditions:\na) Baseline: ReAct agent with no knowledge injection\nb) ConceptNet condition: Query and inject relevant knowledge about:\n   - Properties of water (HasProperty)\n   - Capabilities of water (CapableOf)\n   - Temperature relationships (RelatedTo)\n   - State changes (Causes)\nc) LLM condition: Use gpt-4o-mini to query task-specific knowledge:\n   - Prompt: \"What are the key steps and knowledge needed to boil water? Please provide specific, actionable information about temperatures, state changes, and required actions. Format as a list of facts.\"\nd) Random condition: Randomly select between ConceptNet and LLM knowledge each episode\n\n4. KNOWLEDGE INJECTION\n- Create a knowledge injector that adds selected knowledge to the observation text\n- Format: \"Available knowledge: [knowledge text]\"\n- For ConceptNet, combine relevant facts into a coherent sentence\n- For LLM, use the list of facts directly\n- For Random, alternate between sources\n\n5. REACT AGENT IMPLEMENTATION\n- Use the ReAct agent template\n- Modify observation handling to include injected knowledge\n- Set max tokens=300 for think step\n- Set max tokens=100 for act step\n- Use temperature=0.0 for both\n\n6. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE\nFor each pilot mode:\n- Run all four conditions (baseline, ConceptNet, LLM, random)\n- Log per-step: observation, injected knowledge, thought, action, reward\n- Log per-episode: total steps, final score, success/failure\n- Store knowledge snippets used for analysis\n\n7. ANALYSIS\n- Calculate for each condition:\n  * Success rate\n  * Average steps to completion (successful episodes)\n  * Average reward per episode\n- Use bootstrap resampling to compare:\n  * Each knowledge condition vs baseline\n  * LLM vs ConceptNet directly\n- Generate plots:\n  * Success rates across conditions\n  * Steps to completion distribution\n  * Reward progression over steps\n\n8. OUTPUT\n- Save all logs with timestamps\n- Generate summary statistics\n- Create plots as PDFs\n- Report bootstrap analysis results\n\n9. STOPPING CRITERIA\n- Stop after PILOT phase\n- Report if any condition shows promising improvements\n- Note any technical issues or pattern failures\n\nPlease implement this experiment using the provided codeblocks, focusing on clean integration and proper error handling. Start with MINI_PILOT mode for initial testing.",
