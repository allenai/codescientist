The system should use the following framework:\n\nPILOT FRAMEWORK:\nImplement a global variable PILOT_MODE that can be set to one of: ['MINI_PILOT', 'PILOT', 'FULL_EXPERIMENT']\n- MINI_PILOT: 2 games, 5 actions per game (10 total actions)\n- PILOT: 5 games, 10 actions per game (50 total actions)\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: 20 games, 25 actions per game (500 total actions)\n\nCORE COMPONENTS:\n\n1. Environment Setup:\n- Use TextWorldExpress CookingWorld with simplified parameters: numLocations=3, numIngredients=2, numDistractorItems=2, includeDoors=0\n- Initialize environment with fixed random seed (42) for reproducibility\n\n2. Action Collection:\n- For each game:\n  * Initialize a new game instance\n  * Record the initial state\n  * Sample N random actions from valid_actions (where N depends on PILOT_MODE)\n  * For each action:\n    - Store the pre-action observation, inventory, and valid actions\n    - Execute the action and store the post-action observation\n\n3. LLM Prediction System:\n- For each collected action:\n  * Create a prompt that includes:\n    - Last observation\n    - Current inventory\n    - Proposed action\n  * Query gpt-4o-mini to predict:\n    - Whether the action will succeed (yes/no)\n    - Confidence score (0-1)\n    - Brief rationale\n  * Use this format prompt:\n    \"Given the following game state in a text-based cooking game:\\n\\nObservation: {observation}\\nInventory: {inventory}\\nProposed Action: {action}\\n\\nPredict whether this action will succeed or fail, and provide your confidence.\\n\\nProvide your response in JSON format between code blocks (```), with these keys:\\n- success: true/false (whether you think the action will succeed)\\n- confidence: (0.0-1.0) how confident you are in your prediction\\n- rationale: (brief explanation for your prediction)\"\n\n4. Success/Failure Determination:\n- After each action is executed, use gpt-4o-mini to analyze the observation text to determine if the action succeeded\n- Prompt: \"Did the following action succeed or fail? Respond with only 'success' or 'failure'.\\n\\nAction: {action}\\nResult: {observation}\"\n\n5. Baseline Implementation:\n- Random Prediction: Randomly predict success/failure (50/50)\n- Random Confidence: Generate uniform random confidence scores (0-1)\n- Constant Confidence: Always predict success with 0.5 confidence\n\n6. Analysis:\n- Calculate metrics for both experimental and baseline systems:\n  * Prediction accuracy\n  * Pearson correlation between confidence and accuracy\n  * Average confidence for correct vs incorrect predictions\n- Use bootstrap resampling to assess statistical significance\n- Generate scatter plot of confidence vs accuracy\n- Generate bar plot of average confidence for correct/incorrect predictions\n\n7. Data Storage:\n- Save all predictions, scores, and outcomes in 'results.json'\n- Include for each prediction:\n  * Game ID\n  * Step number\n  * Pre-action observation\n  * Action\n  * Post-action observation\n  * LLM prediction\n  * LLM confidence\n  * LLM rationale\n  * Actual outcome\n  * Baseline predictions\n\n8. Execution Order:\n1. Run MINI_PILOT first\n2. If successful, run PILOT\n3. Stop after PILOT (await human verification before FULL_EXPERIMENT)\n\nPlease implement comprehensive logging throughout the experiment using the Logger class, and generate plots using matplotlib.

The experiment should be implemented with three pilot modes (PILOT_MODE should be a global variable):\n\nPILOT MODES:\n1. MINI_PILOT: 2 episodes, 20 steps max per episode, 2 attempts per task, using training set seeds 1-2\n2. PILOT: 10 episodes, 40 steps max per episode, 5 attempts per task, using training seeds 1-5 for training, dev seeds 1-5 for evaluation\n3. FULL_EXPERIMENT: 100 episodes, 100 steps max, 10 attempts per task, full training/dev/test sets\n\nStart with MINI_PILOT. Only proceed to PILOT after successful MINI_PILOT completion. Stop after PILOT completion.\n\nENVIRONMENT SETUP:\n- Use TextWorldExpress cooking tasks\n- Configure: numLocations=3, numIngredients=2, numDistractorItems=2, includeDoors=0\n- Maximum steps per episode as specified in pilot modes\n- Use training set seeds for collecting experiences, dev set for evaluation\n\nAGENT IMPLEMENTATIONS:\n1. Baseline Agent:\n   - Standard ReAct agent without reflection\n   - Uses gpt-4o-mini for think/act steps\n   - Standard prompt template from ReAct example\n\n2. Basic Reflection Agent:\n   - ReAct agent with reflection but no past experiences\n   - On failure (no reward in last 5 steps), generates reflection using template:\n   \"I failed because [reason]. I should modify my approach by [changes].\"\n\n3. Experience-Guided Reflection Agent:\n   - ReAct agent with reflection using past experiences\n   - Store successful experiences (any step that received positive reward)\n   - Experience format (JSON):\n     {\n         \"task_desc\": str,\n         \"observation\": str,\n         \"action_history\": list,\n         \"reward_history\": list,\n         \"final_reward\": float\n     }\n   - On failure, retrieve most similar past experience\n   - Use template: \"In my current attempt, I failed because [reason]. In a similar situation, I succeeded by [successful_approach]. I should modify my approach by [proposed_changes].\"\n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE:\n1. Experience Collection Phase:\n   - Run baseline agent on training seeds\n   - Store any steps that received positive reward\n   - Save experiences to experiences.json\n\n2. Evaluation Phase:\n   - Run all three agents on evaluation seeds\n   - For each episode:\n     * Record full trajectory\n     * Log all reflections\n     * Track rewards, steps, success/failure\n\n3. Analysis:\n   - Primary metrics:\n     * Average reward per episode\n     * Success rate (proportion of episodes with positive reward)\n     * Average steps to first reward\n   - Secondary metrics:\n     * Number of reflections triggered\n     * Average steps per episode\n   - Use bootstrap resampling to compare metrics between agents\n\nLOGGING:\n- Use Logger for all major events\n- Log format for each step:\n  {\n      \"step_idx\": int,\n      \"agent_type\": str,\n      \"observation\": str,\n      \"think\": str,\n      \"action\": str,\n      \"reward\": float,\n      \"reflection\": str (if any)\n  }\n\nOUTPUT:\n1. Summary statistics for each agent\n2. Bootstrap comparison results\n3. Example reflections from both reflection agents\n4. Learning curves (reward vs episode)\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n- Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls\n- Store experiences across episodes but keep static during evaluation\n- Include past history in ReAct prompts (last 5 steps)\n- Focus on reward rather than task completion\n- Run MINI_PILOT first, then PILOT only if successful",

Use `gpt-4o-mini` for all LLM calls to minimize costs\n2. Implement three pilot modes (set via PILOT_MODE global variable):\n   - MINI_PILOT: 2 episodes, max 20 steps each, training set only\n   - PILOT: 10 episodes, max 50 steps each, using training set (8 episodes) and dev set (2 episodes)\n   - FULL_EXPERIMENT: 50 episodes each condition, max steps 100, proper train/dev/test split\n   Initially run MINI_PILOT, then if successful, run PILOT. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT.\n\nExperiment Structure:\n1. Knowledge Graph Creation:\n   - Create a small static knowledge graph of cooking relationships\n   - Nodes: ingredients and their states (e.g., 'raw carrot', 'diced carrot')\n   - Edges: valid actions and their results (e.g., 'dice->diced', 'cook->cooked')\n   - Save graph in DOT format and generate PDF visualization\n\n2. ReAct Agent Implementation:\n   - Baseline condition: Standard ReAct agent without graph context\n   - Experimental condition: ReAct agent with relevant subgraph included in prompt\n   - Both use same base prompt template except for graph inclusion\n   - Format for graph context: 'Valid cooking relationships:\\n{subgraph_text}'\n\n3. Environment Configuration:\n   - Use CookingWorld with simplified settings:\n     * numLocations: 3\n     * numIngredients: 2 (MINI_PILOT) / 3 (PILOT/FULL)\n     * numDistractorItems: 1 (MINI_PILOT) / 2 (PILOT/FULL)\n     * includeDoors: 0\n     * limitInventorySize: 1\n\n4. Data Collection:\n   - For each episode, record:\n     * Full trajectory (observations, actions, scores)\n     * Valid action rate\n     * Task completion (success/failure)\n     * Number of steps taken\n     * Time per episode\n   - Save all results in JSON format\n\n5. Analysis:\n   - Primary metrics:\n     * Percentage of valid cooking actions\n     * Task completion rate\n     * Average steps to completion\n   - Generate plots:\n     * Line plot comparing valid action rates over episode steps\n     * Bar plot of completion rates\n   - Statistical comparison using bootstrap resampling\n\nRequired Output:\n1. knowledge_graph.dot and knowledge_graph.pdf\n2. results.json containing all experimental data\n3. performance_comparison.pdf with plots\n4. log.json with detailed execution logs\n\nSpecific Implementation Notes:\n1. Knowledge graph should focus on basic cooking actions:\n   - dice/chop/slice -> creates diced/chopped/sliced versions\n   - cook/fry/bake -> creates cooked/fried/baked versions\n   - combine ingredients -> creates combined dishes\n\n2. ReAct agent prompt template should include:\n   - Task description\n   - Current observation\n   - [Experimental only] Relevant subgraph\n   - Format: 'Think: [reasoning]\\nAct: [action]'\n\n3.

The experiment should be implemented with three pilot modes (PILOT_MODE should be a global variable):\n\nPILOT MODES:\n1. MINI_PILOT: 2 episodes, 15 steps max per episode, 1 CookingWorld task (training set)\n2. PILOT: 10 episodes, 25 steps max per episode, 2 CookingWorld tasks (training set)\n3. FULL_EXPERIMENT: 50 episodes, 50 steps max per episode, 5 CookingWorld tasks (proper train/dev/test split)\n\nPlease implement MINI_PILOT first, then PILOT if successful. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT.\n\nSPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:\n1. Environment Setup:\n   - Use TextWorldExpress CookingWorld with simplified settings (numLocations=3, numIngredients=2, numDistractorItems=2, includeDoors=0)\n   - Log all environment interactions using the Logger\n\n2. Conditions to Compare:\n   - Baseline: Single-agent reflection\n   - Experimental: Sequential dual-agent reflection\n   - Control: Random action selection (no reflection)\n\n3. Reflection Process:\n   - Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls (both reflection and evaluation)\n   - Single-agent reflection prompt: \"Please analyze this cooking task experience and provide insights for improvement. Focus on: 1) What worked well, 2) What didn't work, 3) Specific strategies for better performance.\"\n   - Dual-agent reflection process:\n     * First agent: Same prompt as single-agent\n     * Second agent: \"Building on the previous reflection, please provide additional insights or refinements. What other strategies or improvements would you suggest?\"\n\n4. Data Collection:\n   - For each episode:\n     * Save full trajectory (observations, actions, scores)\n     * Save reflection outputs\n     * Save performance metrics\n   - Use unique IDs and timestamps\n   - Log all LLM interactions\n\n5. Evaluation:\n   - Primary metric: Score improvement (comparing scores before/after applying insights)\n   - Secondary metric: GPT-4o-mini rating of reflection quality (0-1 scale)\n   - Use bootstrap resampling to compare conditions\n\n6. Output Format:\n   - Save all data in JSON format\n   - Include summary statistics\n   - Generate performance comparison plots\n\nRequired Statistical Analysis:\n1. Bootstrap resampling to compare:\n   - Single vs Dual reflection performance\n   - Both reflection conditions vs random baseline\n2. Report p-values and effect sizes\n\nSuccess Criteria for Advancing from MINI_PILOT to PILOT:\n1. All components run without errors\n2. Data is properly logged\n3. Statistical comparisons execute successfully\n\nPlease implement appropriate error handling and logging throughout. The experiment should be able to resume from the last completed episode if interrupted.",

Use TextWorldExpress CookingWorld\n2. Configure for 2 rooms\n3. Set recipe complexity to 1-2 ingredients\n4. Disable doors (includeDoors=0)\n5. Use seeds 1-N for N episodes (training set seeds)\n\nAGENT IMPLEMENTATIONS:\n1. Baseline ReAct Agent:\n- Use standard ReAct implementation with think-then-act steps\n- Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls\n- Include observation history in prompts (last 5 steps)\n\n2. Enhanced ReAct Agent (with additional evaluation):\n- Start with baseline ReAct agent\n- After the 'act' step but before executing:\n  a) Generate evaluation prompt that includes:\n     - Current observation\n     - Last 5 steps of history\n     - Proposed action\n     - Task description\n  b) Ask gpt-4o-mini to evaluate if action is reasonable (force JSON response with key 'is_reasonable':bool)\n  c) If not reasonable, run ReAct step again for new action\n  d) Maximum 2 retries before accepting last action\n\n3. Random Baseline:\n- Randomly select from valid actions each step\n\nDATA COLLECTION:\nFor each episode, log:\n1. Episode parameters (seed, max steps)\n2. For each step:\n   - Observation\n   - Score\n   - Valid actions\n   - Planned action\n   - Evaluation result (for enhanced agent)\n   - Final chosen action\n   - Whether action was successful\n   - Task score\n\nANALYSIS:\n1.

Secondary metrics:\n   - Percentage of actions rejected by evaluator (enhanced agent)\n   - Percentage of invalid actions attempted\n\n3. Statistical Analysis:\n   - Use bootstrap resampling to compare:\n     a) Enhanced vs Baseline ReAct\n     b) Both agents vs Random baseline\n   - Report p-values and effect sizes\n\nEXPERIMENT FLOW:\n1. Start with MINI_PILOT mode\n2. Run all three agents (baseline, enhanced, random)\n3. Perform analysis and generate plots\n4. If successful, proceed to PILOT mode\n5.

PILOT SETTINGS\nImplement three pilot settings controlled by a global PILOT_MODE variable:\n- MINI_PILOT: Test on 2 scenarios, 3 decisions each\n- PILOT: Test on 5 scenarios, 5 decisions each\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: Test on 20 scenarios, 10 decisions each\nStart with MINI_PILOT, then if successful, run PILOT. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT.\n\n2. TEST SCENARIOS\nCreate simple social scenarios with 2-3 characters with clear relationship dynamics:\nMINI_PILOT Scenarios:\n- Scenario 1: Two friends planning a birthday party for a third friend\n- Scenario 2: Two rivals competing for a promotion, with a neutral coworker\n\nEach scenario should have:\n- Initial character relationships (friend/neutral/enemy)\n- A sequence of decision points where the agent must choose an action\n- Ground truth appropriate actions for evaluation\n\n3. AGENT IMPLEMENTATIONS\nImplement three agents using gpt-4o-mini:\na) Experimental Agent (with graph):\n- Maintains relationship graph using DOT/Graphviz\n- Updates relationships based on interactions\n- Uses relationship context in prompts for decisions\n\nb) Baseline Agent 1 (no graph):\n- Makes decisions without relationship tracking\n- Gets only current scenario context\n\nc) Baseline Agent 2 (static relationships):\n- Assumes all relationships are friendly\n- No relationship updates\n\n4. GRAPH IMPLEMENTATION\n- Use DOT/Graphviz format\n- Nodes: Character names\n- Edges: Relationships (friend/neutral/enemy)\n- Color code relationships (green=friend, yellow=neutral, red=enemy)\n- Save graph state as PDF after each decision\n\n5. EVALUATION PROCEDURE\nFor each scenario:\na) Initialize relationship graph\nb) For each decision point:\n   - Log current state\n   - Get agent decisions\n   - Save graph visualization\n   - Have gpt-4o-mini evaluate decision appropriateness (scale 1-5)\n   - Update relationships based on decision outcomes\nc) Store results in JSON format:\n   {\"scenario\": str, \"decision_point\": int, \"agent_type\": str, \"decision\": str, \"appropriateness_score\": float, \"graph_state\": str}\n\n6. ANALYSIS\n- Calculate mean appropriateness scores per agent\n- Use bootstrap resampling to compare experimental vs baselines\n- Report p-values and effect sizes\n- Generate summary visualizations of results\n\n7. LOGGING\n- Log all LLM interactions\n- Log all graph states\n- Log all decisions and scores\n- Log any errors or warnings\n\nThe experiment should first run in MINI_PILOT mode (2 scenarios). If successful, proceed to PILOT mode (5 scenarios). Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT mode.\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n1. All agents successfully make decisions\n2. Graphs are properly visualized and saved\n3. Evaluation scores are collected\n4. Statistical analysis is completed\n5. All results are logged\n\nPlease implement this experiment using the provided codeblocks, focusing on clean logging and error handling for the pilot phase.",

Your goal is to follow recipes and cook dishes.\n\nThink carefully about each step. You can:\n1. Look around to observe the environment\n2. Check your inventory\n3. Move between locations\n4. Interact with objects (take, drop, open, close)\n5. Cook ingredients\n\nFormat your responses as:\nThought: (your reasoning)\nAction: (your chosen action)\n```\n\nEXPERIMENTAL: ReAct agent with rules in prompt:\n```\nYou are a cooking agent in a text-based kitchen environment. Your goal is to follow recipes and cook dishes.\n\nFOLLOW THESE IMPORTANT RULES:\n1. ALWAYS read the recipe/cookbook first to know what to cook\n2. ALWAYS check what ingredients you need before starting\n3. NEVER cook ingredients before slicing them if required\n4. NEVER serve food before heating/cooking it properly\n5. ALWAYS check your inventory before taking new items\n\nThink carefully about each step. You can:\n1. Look around to observe the environment\n2. Check your inventory\n3. Move between locations\n4. Interact with objects (take, drop, open, close)\n5. Cook ingredients\n\nFormat your responses as:\nThought: (your reasoning)\nAction: (your chosen action)\n```\n\n3. For each episode:\n   - Log the full trajectory (observation, score, valid actions, chosen action)\n   - Track task completion status\n   - Record number of steps taken\n   - Calculate percentage of valid actions (actions that changed the environment state)\n\n4. Analysis:\n   - Generate line plots comparing:\n     a) Task completion rates over episodes\n     b) Percentage of valid actions over episodes\n   - Use bootstrap resampling to test for significant differences between conditions\n   - Save plots as PDFs: 'completion_rates.pdf' and 'valid_actions.pdf'\n\n5. Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls (as specified in conditioning)\n\nIMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:\n1. Start with MINI_PILOT mode for initial testing\n2. Only proceed to PILOT mode if MINI_PILOT successful\n3. Stop after PILOT mode - require human verification before FULL_EXPERIMENT\n4. Include task history in the ReAct prompt to help agent track progress\n5. Log all LLM calls and responses for debugging\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n1. Save all logs to 'log.json'\n2. Generate summary statistics for each pilot mode\n3. Create comparison plots as specified\n4. Report bootstrap resampling results\n5. Include clear success/failure criteria for proceeding to next pilot stage",

EXPERIMENT STRUCTURE:\nCreate a global variable PILOT_MODE that can be set to 'MINI_PILOT', 'PILOT', or 'FULL_EXPERIMENT'. The code should run different scales of experiment based on this setting:\n- MINI_PILOT: 2 training episodes (seeds 1-2) and 2 test episodes (seeds 3-4), max 20 steps per episode\n- PILOT: 10 training episodes (seeds 1-10) and 5 test episodes (seeds 11-15), max 40 steps per episode\n- FULL_EXPERIMENT: 50 training episodes and 25 test episodes, max 100 steps per episode\n\n2. ENVIRONMENT SETUP:\n- Use TextWorldExpress CookingWorld with simplified parameters: numLocations=3, numIngredients=2, numDistractorItems=2, includeDoors=0\n- Use the same seeds for both baseline and experimental conditions to ensure fair comparison\n\n3. AGENT IMPLEMENTATIONS:\nA. Baseline Agent:\n- Standard ReAct agent using gpt-4o-mini\n- Single LLM call combining think/act steps\n\nB. Pattern-Learning Agent:\n- Modified ReAct agent that stores and reuses reasoning patterns\n- Define a 'successful reasoning chain' as the sequence of 5 steps (observation, thought, action) preceding any score increase\n- Store these chains in JSON files with: initial observation, goal, sequence of steps, and final score delta\n- Before each new reasoning step, check stored patterns for similar situations using simple text similarity\n- If a similar pattern exists (similarity > 0.7), adapt it to current situation\n\n4. EVALUATION METRICS:\n- Primary: Average score achieved (not binary success/failure)\n- Secondary: Average steps per episode\n- Pattern reuse rate (% of steps where a stored pattern was used)\n- Score increase rate (number of score increases per episode)\n\n5. LOGGING:\n- Log every step: observation, thought, action, score, valid actions\n- For pattern-learning agent, also log:\n  * When patterns are stored (including the pattern)\n  * When patterns are reused (including similarity score)\n  * Pattern adaptation process\n\n6. ANALYSIS:\n- Compare score distributions between conditions using bootstrap resampling\n- Generate learning curves (score vs. episode) for both conditions\n- Plot histogram of pattern reuse rates\n- Report pattern adaptation success rate\n\n7. EXECUTION ORDER:\n1. Run MINI_PILOT first\n2. If successful, run PILOT\n3. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT (await human verification)\n\nIMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:\n- Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls\n- Store patterns in a 'patterns.json' file\n- Use cosine similarity for pattern matching\n- Log all errors and debugging info\n- Generate plots as PDFs\n\nEXPECTED OUTPUT:\n1. Log file with all execution details\n2. Plots:\n   - Learning curves (score vs. episode)\n   - Pattern reuse rate histogram\n   - Score increase rate comparison\n3. Statistical analysis results\n4. Stored patterns file\n\nThe experiment should focus on demonstrating whether pattern reuse leads to faster score increases and higher final scores, rather than binary task completion.",

The experiment should be structured in three pilot modes (MINI_PILOT, PILOT, and FULL_EXPERIMENT), controlled by a global PILOT_MODE variable.\n\nKey Parameters by Pilot Mode:\nMINI_PILOT:\n- Collect 2 trajectories for template discovery\n- Test on 3 new episodes\n- Maximum 20 steps per episode\n- Use training set seeds 1-5\n\nPILOT:\n- Collect 5 trajectories for template discovery\n- Test on 10 new episodes\n- Maximum 50 steps per episode\n- Use training set seeds 1-20 for training, dev set seeds 1-10 for testing\n\nFULL_EXPERIMENT:\n- Collect 20 trajectories for template discovery\n- Test on 50 new episodes\n- Maximum 100 steps per episode\n- Use training set for training, dev set for parameter tuning, test set for final evaluation\n\nSpecific Implementation Steps:\n\n1. Environment Setup:\n- Use TextWorldExpress CookingWorld with default parameters except:\n  - numLocations=3 (to reduce complexity)\n  - includeDoors=0 (to reduce complexity)\n  - numIngredients=2 (to increase likelihood of partial success)\n\n2. Template Discovery Phase:\n- Create a random agent with valid action filtering to collect training trajectories\n- For each trajectory:\n  - Store the sequence of (observation, valid_actions, chosen_action, score)\n  - Track the partial task score (0-1) at each step\n  - Consider a trajectory 'successful' if it achieves a score > 0.5\n- Extract all consecutive pairs of actions from successful trajectories\n- Keep pairs that appear more than once as templates\n- Log discovered templates and their frequencies\n\n3. Agent Implementation:\na) Template Agent:\n- For each step:\n  - Get valid actions\n  - Check if any template's first action matches a current valid action\n  - If yes, attempt to use that template\n  - If no template applies or second action invalid, fall back to random valid action\n  - Log whether action came from template or fallback\n\nb) Baseline Agents:\n- Random agent (using valid action filtering)\n- Primitive action agent (using valid action filtering, but no templates)\n\n4. Evaluation:\n- Run each agent (template, random baseline, primitive baseline) on the same set of episodes\n- For each episode, track:\n  - Partial task score (0-1) at each step\n  - Final score achieved\n  - Number of steps taken\n  - For template agent: number of successful template applications\n\n5. Analysis:\n- Compare agents using bootstrap resampling on:\n  - Final scores achieved\n  - Steps taken (for episodes achieving score > 0)\n- Report template usage statistics:\n  - Number of unique templates discovered\n  - Template application success rate\n  - Most frequently used templates\n\n6. Logging:\n- Log all trajectories with:\n  - Observation at each step\n  - Valid actions available\n  - Action chosen\n  - Score achieved\n  - Template used (if applicable)\n\nSpecial Instructions:\n- Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls\n- Start with MINI_PILOT mode\n- If successful, proceed to PILOT mode\n- Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT (await human verification)\n- Focus on partial task scores (0-1) rather than binary task success\n\nOutput Requirements:\n1. Detailed logs of all runs\n2. Statistical comparison of agent performance\n3. Template discovery and usage statistics\n4. Clear indication of which pilot mode was run\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n- Code runs without errors\n- Templates are successfully discovered\n- Statistical analysis shows whether template usage affects performance\n- All metrics and analyses are properly logged",

LOGGING:\n- Log all observations, actions, and graph changes\n- Log LLM prompts and responses\n- Log metrics after each episode\n- Save graphs as both .dot and .pdf at each step\n\n7. OUTPUT:\n- Generate summary statistics for each condition\n- Create comparison plots between conditions\n- Save all raw data and graphs\n- Report statistical significance of differences\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n1. Start with MINI_PILOT mode for initial testing\n2. Only proceed to PILOT if MINI_PILOT successful\n3. Stop after PILOT - await human verification before FULL_EXPERIMENT\n4. Use gpt-4o-mini for all LLM calls\n5.

Use bootstrap resampling to compare:\n   - Task scores between baseline and experimental\n   - Steps per episode between conditions\n2. Generate summary statistics for each condition\n\nEXPERIMENT FLOW:\n1. Start with MINI_PILOT mode\n2. If successful, proceed to PILOT mode\n3. Stop before FULL_EXPERIMENT (await human verification)\n4. Save all results and graphs in a timestamped directory\n\nERROR HANDLING:\n1. Log all errors and exceptions\n2. Save partial results if experiment fails\n3. Include error recovery for LLM API failures\n\nPlease implement this experiment using the provided codeblocks. Start in MINI_PILOT mode for initial testing and debugging.",
